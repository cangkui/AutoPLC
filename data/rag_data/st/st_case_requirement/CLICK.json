    "description": "CLICK is a button interface which automatically adjusts to the connected\n\nswitch. If a switch is connected, CLICK recognize themselves whether it is\n\nan opener or closer, and then evaluates each case only the frst fank.\n\nWith the setup variable T_DEBOUNCE the debounce of the buttons is set.\n\nIt is set by default to 10 ms. The time T_RESetup is used to decide whe￾ther a make or break is connected to the input IN. If the input is for more\n\nthan this time in a state, it is assumed as rest mode. The default value is 1\n\nminute for T_RESetup. With short successive pulses a single, double or tri￾ple pulse evaluated and switches according to the output SINGLE, DOUBLE\n\nor TRIPLE. If the pulse is longer than the setup time T_SHORT or a pause\n\nbetween two pulses is longer than T_PAUSE, then the pulse sequence is in￾terrupted and the corresponding output is set, until the contrary input pul￾se is inactive. The output Q corresponds to the input pulse. However, it is\n\nalways High- active. An ESR compliant status output indicates state chan￾ges to subsequent ESR compliant evaluation modules. With short pulses,\n\nthe output SINGLE (one pulse), DOUBLE (2 pulses) or TRIPLE (3 pulses) is\n\n47 Version 1.00\n\nChapter 6. Electrical Engineering\n\nselected.

By specifying a rectangular area by means of the \n\nparameters X1, Y1 and X2, Y2, a basic framework is defned, at which at \n\nthe right and bottom color darkened lines are drawn (shadow). The \n\nshadow coordinates X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 are always given +1 for proper \n\nprimitive. OPTION means you can choose between two shadow variations. \n\nIf OPITION = 0 then the shadow is reached by pure color adjustment \n\n(darkening of the character) . If an OPTION > 0, in the area of the shadow \n\nall the characters replaced by black flled characters.",

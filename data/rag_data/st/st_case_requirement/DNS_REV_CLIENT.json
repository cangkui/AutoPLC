For this purpose a reverse DNS query on the \n\nconfgured IP address with a DNS server is made. With positive edge of \n\nACTIVATE the specifed IP is stored so that they no longer must be present. \n\nIf the query result in more matches, it will always use the last record. As \n\nIP4_DNS can be used any public DNS servers. If the PLC is sitting behind a \n\nDSL router, this router can be used as a DNS server through its gateway \n\naddress. Which ultimately leads to faster even with repeated requests \n\nresponse times because they are managed in the router cache. With \n\npositive results DONE = TRUE the DOMAIN contains the ofcially \n\nregistered domain name until the start of the next query by positive edge \n\nof ACTIVATE.

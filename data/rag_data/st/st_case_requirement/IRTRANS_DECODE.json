    "description": "IRTRANS_DECODE receives the data from the module IRTRANS_SERVER\n\npresent in BUFFER, checks if a valid data package is available and deco￾des the name of the remote control and the name of the button form the\n\ndata packet. If a valid data packet has been decoded, the name of the re￾mote control is passed at the output DEV and the name of the button on\n\nthe output KEY. The output CMD signals that the new output data are pre￾sent. The ERROR output is then set when a data packet was received that\n\nis not in the correct format.\n\nThe format is defned as follows:\n\n'Name of the remote control', 'Name of the key code' $R$N\n\nA data packet consists of the name of the remote control, followed by a\n\ncomma and then the name of the key codes. The data packet is a comple￾ted by Carriage Return and a Line Feed . \n\nTo ensure that IRTRANS_DECODE works in the IRTrans confguration the\n\nCheck box BROADCAST IR RELAY must be checked and in the correspon￾ding Device database under the DEFAULT ACTION the String '%r%c\\r\\n'\n\nmust be registered. IRTRANS_DECODE evaluates just this String and deco￾des %r as the name and %c as pressed a button of the remote control.",

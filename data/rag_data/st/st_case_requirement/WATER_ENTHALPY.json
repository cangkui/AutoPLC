    "description": "WATER_ENTHALPY calculates the Enthalpy (Heat content) of liquid water\n\nas a function of temperature at atmospheric pressure. The temperature T\n\nis given in Celsius. The calculation is valid for a temperature of 0 to 100 °\n\nC and the result is the amount of heat needed to head the water from 0 °\n\nC to a temperature of T. The result is expressed in joules / gram J / g and\n\npassed as KJ/Kg. It is calculated by linear interpolation in steps of 10 ° and\n\nthus reach a sufcient accuracy for non-scientifc applications. A possible\n\nApplication of WATER_ENTHALPY is to calculate the amount of energy nee￾ded, for example, to head a bufer tank at X (T2 - T1) degree. From the\n\nenergy required then the runtime of a boiler can be calculated exactly and\n\nthe required energy can be provided. Since there temperature readings\n\nare signifcantly delays, with this method a better heating is possible in\n\npractice.",

    "description": "IRTRANS_SND_8 allows users to send remote control commands to the IR￾Trans. If IN_x is TRUE the specifed device and key code in setup is sent to\n\nthe IRTrans which outputs in turn as a real remote control commands. With\n\nT_REPEAT the repeat time for sending can be specifed . If IN_0 remains\n\nconstant to TRUE so always this key code sent repeated after the time\n\nT_REPEAT. If a change to a diferent IN_x occures this code will send imme￾diately and then again delayed with T_REPEAT, if it remains a long period\n\nof time. At output KEY the currently controlled KEY will be displayed. KEY\n\n= 0 means that no IN_x is active. The values 1-3 are the IN_0 - IN_7.\n\n45 Version 1.21\n\nChapter 7. Data Logger\n\n 7.

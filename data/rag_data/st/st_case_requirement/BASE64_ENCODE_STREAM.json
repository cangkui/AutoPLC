Here, the source data is passed to\n\nthe encoder over BUF1 in the data-stream manner as individual blocks of\n\ndata, and in coded form re-issued in BUF2. The user has to provide the fur￾ther processing of the BUF2 data before the next block of data is conver￾ted. The number of bytes in BUF2 is issued by SIZE2 from the module.",

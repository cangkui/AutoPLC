The element is shown in *.in_X and \n\n*.in_Y. The menu items are stored as elements within *.st_Menu_Text. The \n\nindividual element are devided from each other using '#'. To devide \n\nindividual sub-menu items from each other or providing them with a cut \n\nline, an '-' has to submitted as text menu-element.\n\nWithin the sub-menu can be navigated with up / down key. If a sub-menu \n\nitem is confrmed by pressing Enter / Return key, then in \n\n*.in_Menu_Selected the number of the selected menu-point is passed.\n\nAn active Menu automatically backs up the background before it is drawn, \n\nand restores the background after ending.\n\nAs long as a menu is display, the user program may not make graphical \n\nchanges. This can be checked by TN_SCREEN.bo_Menue_Bar_Dialog = \n\nTRUE or TN_SCREEN.bo_Modal_Dialog = TRUE.\n\nThe module is primarily from TN_INPUT_MENU_BAR and \n\nTN_INPUT_SELECT_POPUP used internally, and need not be executed \n\ndirectly by the user.",

At each coordinate (position) any displayable characters \n\nwith selectable color attributes can be displayed.\n\nThe horizontal axis (from left to right) is called standard with X, and \n\nincludes the positions 00-79. The vertical axis (from top to bottom) is \n\ncalled by default to Y and includes the positions 00-23. For pure \n\ncoordinates specify the location with X and Y. If an area (rectangle) are \n\nindicated, the upper-left corner and lower right corner X1/Y1 with X2, Y2 \n\ndefned.\n\nThe individual characters can be equipped with color attributes. A color \n\nattributes consist of a byte, where the left nibble (4 bits) the ink color \n\n(foreground color), and the right nibble (4 bits) the background color \n\ndefnes.",

    "description": "IRTRANS_SERVER can be used as both a receiver and a transmitter of IR￾TRANS commands. Is UDP_TCP = TRUE is a passive TCP connection, other￾wise set up a passive UDP connection. The type of operation must also be\n\nconfgured with IRTRANS device. Once a data connection is available and\n\nsending commands is allowed, S_ENABLE = TRUE. In UDP mode, after the\n\ninitial data received from IRTRANS, data can be sent, since in the passive\n\nmode, the UDP-IP parameter is initially not known. The receiving mode is\n\nindicated with R_ENABLE. If data are received they are available in R_BUF\n\nfor further processing for other modules. Send data has to be entered by\n\nthe modules in the S_BUF, so they are then sent automatically from IR-\n\n40 Version 1.21\n\nChapter 6. Device Driver\n\nTRANS_SERVER. If transmission errors occurs, they are issued with \"ER￾ROR\" (see module IP_CONTROL2). Existing errors are acknowledged auto￾matically every 5 seconds by the module.\n\nUDP server mode:\n\nIn the IRTRANS Web confguration, the IP address of the PLC is entered as\n\na broadcast address.\n\nIRTRANS Web Confguration:\n\nThe following example shows the application of IRTRANS Devices\n\n41 Version 1.21\n\nChapter 6.

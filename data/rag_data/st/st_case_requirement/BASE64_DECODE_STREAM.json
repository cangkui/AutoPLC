Here, the source data is passed to the\n\n73 Version 1.21\n\nChapter 8. Converter\n\ndecoder over BUF1 in the data-stream manner as individual blocks of\n\ndata, and in decoded form re-issued in BUF2. The user has to provide the\n\nfurther processing of the BUF2 data before the next block of data is conï¿¾verted. The number of bytes in BUF2 is issued by SIZE2 from the module.",

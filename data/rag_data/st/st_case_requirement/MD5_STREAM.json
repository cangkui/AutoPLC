    "description": "MD5_STREAM allows the calculation of the MD5 ( Mes￾sage-Digest Algorithm 5 ) of a cryptographic hash function. \n\nThis can be created from any data stream a unique check value. It is vir￾tually impossible to fnd two diferent messages with the same test value,\n\nthis is referred to as collisions free. This can be used to check a confgura￾tion fle for change or manipulation.\n\nWith the hash algorithm (MD5) a hash value is generated from 128 bits in\n\nlength for any data. The maximum length of the stream is on this module\n\nis limited to 2^32 (4 gigabyte). The result is a 16 bytes hash value at pa￾rameters MD5.",

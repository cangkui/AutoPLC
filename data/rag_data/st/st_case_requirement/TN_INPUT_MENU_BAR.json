    "description": "TN_INPUT_MENU_BAR is used to manage and view the \n\nMenu_Bar. The element is shown in *.in_X and *.in_Y. The menu items are \n\nstored as elements within verschachelte *.st_MENU_TEXT. Two diferent \n\nseparators are used. A '$' separates the diferent menu lists, and each \n\nmenu list is further divided by '#' into individual menu items. The frst \n\nmenu list is the actual menu bar, this implies the number of sub-menus, \n\nand the titles of the elements. Then all the sub-menu lists are follow and \n\nare separated by '%'. To devide individual sub-menu items from each other \n\nor providing them with a cut line, an '-' has to submitted as text menuï¿¾element.\n\nBy pressing the Escape key, the menu bar activated and the respective \n\nsub-menu is displayed using the module TN_INPUT_MENU_POPUP. Within \n\nthe sub-menu can be navigated with up / down key. Within the sub-menu \n\ncan be navigated with up / down cursor. If a sub-menu item is confrmed \n\nby pressing Enter / Return key, then in *.in_Menu_Selected the number of \n\nthe selected menu-point is passed. The calculation of the menu item \n\nnumber is as following: Main menu index * 10 + Submenu-index. The entry \n\nin *.in_Menu_Selected needs set again to 0 after acceptance by users.\n\nThus, a maximum of 9 main menu items and each 9-Submenu items are \n\nexecutable. Means of escape key at any time the menu can be hided \n\nagain.\n\n176 Version 1.21\n\nChapter 11. Telnet-Vision\n\nActive Menu automatically backs up the background before it is drawn, \n\nand restores the background after ending.\n\nAs long as a menu is display, the user program may not make graphical \n\nchanges. This can be checked by TN_SCREEN.bo_Menue_Bar_Dialog = \n\nTRUE.",

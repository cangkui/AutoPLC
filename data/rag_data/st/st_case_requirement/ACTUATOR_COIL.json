If the setup variable SELF_ACT_CYCLE set to a value\n\ngreater than 0, the valve is automatically activated for the duration of\n\nSELF_ACT_TIME if it was of for the time SELF_ACT_CYCLE. An ESR compli￾ant status output indicates state changes of the valve for further proces￾sing or Data Logging. The status messages are defned as follows:\n\nSTATUS = 100, Standby. \n\nSTATUS = 101, valve was activated by TRUE at the input IN.\n\nSTATUS = 102, valve was activated automatically.",

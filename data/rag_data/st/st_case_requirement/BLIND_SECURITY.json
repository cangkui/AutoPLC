    "description": "BLIND_SECURITY makes sure the blinds drive either up or down when cer￾tain events occur. The inputs UP and DN control a downstream module\n\nBLIND_ACTUATOR over the outputs of QU and QD. With the inputs FIRE,\n\nWIND, RAIN ALARM the inputs UP and DN are overwritten and the blinds\n\ndrive either completely up or completely down. This FIRE has the highest\n\npriority followed by WIND, Alarm and with the lowest priority RAIN. Rain\n\ncan be overridden as the only one by manual inputs UP and DN. Therefore,\n\nif the user should decide to remain open the blind despite the rain, he\n\nmust interrupt the rain mode only by a short press of the UP or DN. FIRE\n\ndrives the shutter to the top while RAIN, Wind and Alarm are confgurable\n\nfor up or down. ALARM is confgured using the setup variables ALARM_UP\n\nfor both high and down drive, the setup variable WIND_UP specifes whe￾ther to run in Wind up or down. The variable RAIN_UP determine what po￾sition will be approached at Rain. The default values are UPfor Alarm, UP\n\nfor Wind and DNfor Rain. The setup variables can be changed by dou￾ble-clicking the icon at any time. \n\nThe input and output S_IN STATUS are ESR compliant outputs and inputs.\n\nIn Input S_IN the upstream functions report their status to the module, this\n\nstatus will be forwarded to the output of STATUS, and own status messa￾ges also issued on STATUS.\n\nSTATUS Meaning\n\n0 no message\n\n111 Fire\n\n112 Wind\n\n113 Burglar alarm\n\n114 Door alarm\n\n90 Version 1.00\n\nChapter 7.

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `LIST_CLEAN`, is designed to clean duplicate separators from a list of strings. It iterates through the string array, removes consecutive occurrences of the separator, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `SEP`, representing the separator, of type `BYTE`.\n  - Input-output variable: `LIST`, representing the string list to be cleaned, of type `STRING[LIST_LENGTH]`.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the string array, of type `POINTER TO ARRAY[1..LIST_LENGTH] OF BYTE`.\n    - `read`: An index for traversing the array, initialized to 1, of type `INT`.\n    - `write`: An index for writing the cleaned data, initialized to 1, of type `INT`.\n    - `last`: Stores the value of the previous character, of type `BYTE`.\n    - `c`: Stores the value of the current character, of type `BYTE`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - The pointer `pt` is set to the address of the string array `LIST` to enable array access via the pointer.\n     - `read` and `write` are initialized to 1, indicating the start of reading and writing from the first element of the array.\n     - `last` is initialized to an undefined value (defaulting to 0).\n\n  -- REGION Array Traversal\n     - A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through the array from 1 to `LIST_LENGTH`.\n     - In each iteration, the current character `c` is set to `pt^[read]`, the current element in the array.\n     - If `c` is 0 (the string terminator), the loop exits.\n     - If `c` is not the separator `SEP`, or if the current separator is different from the previous character `last`, `c` is written to `pt^[write]`, and the `write` index is incremented.\n     - `last` is updated to the current character `c` for comparison in the next iteration.\n\n  -- REGION Trailing Separator Cleanup\n     - If the last character `last` is the separator `SEP`, the `write` index is decremented by 1 to remove the trailing separator.\n     - If `write` is less than or equal to the string length `STRING_LENGTH`, the string terminator 0 is written at `pt^[write]`.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     - The function return value `LIST_CLEAN` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the cleaning operation was completed successfully.\n\n- Summary\nThis function iterates through the string array, removes consecutive separators, and ensures the string ends with the terminator 0. It returns `TRUE` to indicate success. The function is useful for eliminating redundant separators in string lists, making them more concise and standardized.", "name": "LIST_CLEAN"}

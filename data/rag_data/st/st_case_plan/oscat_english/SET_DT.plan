{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SET_DT`, which combines year, month, day, hour, minute, and second into a `DT` (datetime) type value. The function converts the date and time parts into `DWORD` type separately, then adds them together, and finally converts the result into `DT` type.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines several types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`â€”these specify the date and time.\n  - Return value: `SET_DT`, the function returns a `DT` type datetime value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function combines the input date and time parts into a `DT` type value. The steps are as follows:\n    1. **Date Part**: The `SET_DATE` function combines `year`, `month`, and `day` into a date value, which is then converted to `DWORD` type using `DATE_TO_DWORD`.\n    2. **Time Part**: The `second`, `minute`, and `hour` values are converted to `DWORD` type and weighted based on time units (seconds, minutes, hours):\n       - `second` is directly converted to `DWORD`.\n       - `minute` is multiplied by 60 (converting minutes to seconds).\n       - `hour` is multiplied by 3600 (converting hours to seconds).\n    3. **Combine Date and Time**: The `DWORD` value of the date part is added to the `DWORD` value of the time part, resulting in a `DWORD` value representing both date and time.\n    4. **Convert to DT Type**: The final `DWORD` value is converted to `DT` type using `DWORD_TO_DT` and returned as the function's output.\n\n    Ultimately, the function returns a `DT` type value containing the specified date and time.", "name": "SET_DT"}

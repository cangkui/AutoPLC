{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function named `ISC_NUM`, designed to determine whether an input byte value represents a numeric character (ASCII codes between 48 and 57).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BYTE`, representing the ASCII character value to be checked.\n  - Return value: `ISC_NUM`, of type `BOOL`, indicating the result of the check.\n\n- Main Logic\n  - REGION Main Logic:\n    The function's logic is straightforward. It checks if the input value `IN` falls within the ASCII range for numeric characters. If `IN` is greater than 47 (ASCII value for '0' is 48) and less than 58 (ASCII value for '9' is 57), the function returns `TRUE`, indicating the input is a numeric character; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.", "name": "ISC_NUM"}

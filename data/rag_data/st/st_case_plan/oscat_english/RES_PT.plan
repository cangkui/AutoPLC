{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `RES_PT` designed to calculate the resistance value of a platinum resistance temperature sensor (such as PT100). The function computes the resistance based on temperature `T` and reference resistance `R0`. The calculation accounts for both positive and negative temperature ranges by using different formulas to ensure accuracy.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `T`: Temperature value, type `REAL`.\n    - `R0`: Reference resistance value (typically the resistance at 0°C), type `REAL`.\n  - Constants:\n    - `A`, `B`, `C`: Constant values representing the temperature coefficients of platinum resistance, type `REAL`.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `T2`: Squared temperature value, type `REAL`, used to simplify calculations.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Resistance Value:\n    1. First, compute the squared temperature value `T2` as `T2 := T * T`.\n    2. Check whether the temperature `T` is greater than or equal to 0°C:\n       - If `T >= 0.0`, use the formula `RES_PT := R0 * (1.0 + A * T + B * T2)` to calculate the resistance. This formula applies to the positive temperature range.\n       - If `T < 0.0`, use the formula `RES_PT := R0 * (1.0 + A * T + B * T2 + C * (T - 100.0) * T2 * T)` to calculate the resistance. This formula applies to the negative temperature range, incorporating an additional coefficient `C` for improved accuracy.\n    3. Finally, the function returns the computed resistance value `RES_PT`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function calculates the resistance value of a platinum resistance temperature sensor based on temperature `T` and reference resistance `R0`. It selects different calculation formulas depending on whether the temperature is positive or negative to ensure high precision across the entire range. The constants `A`, `B`, and `C` are temperature coefficients for platinum resistance, used to correct for the nonlinear characteristics of resistance changes with temperature.", "name": "RES_PT"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `CLEAN`, is designed to clean the input string `IN` by removing any characters that are present in another string `CX`. The function returns the cleaned string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `IN`: The input string to be cleaned.\n    - `CX`: The string containing characters to be removed.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pos`: An index used to traverse the input string, initialized to 1.\n    - `stop`: The length of the input string, used to control the loop termination condition.\n\n- Main Logic\n  - Initialization:\n    - Assign the input string `IN` to the output variable `CLEAN`.\n    - Calculate the length of the input string `IN` and assign it to `stop` to control the loop termination.\n  - Loop Processing:\n    - Use a `WHILE` loop to traverse the input string `IN`, starting from the first character (`pos = 1`).\n    - In each iteration, use the `MID` function to extract a substring from `CLEAN` starting from the first character up to the current `pos` position.\n    - Use the `FIND` function to check if this substring is present in `CX`. If it is, increment `pos` and continue checking the next character.\n    - If it is not present, use the `DELETE` function to remove the substring from `CLEAN` and update the `stop` value (reducing it by the length of `pos`).\n  - Termination Condition:\n    - The loop ends when `pos` exceeds `stop`, and the function returns the cleaned string `CLEAN`.\n\n- Detailed Logic\n  - The core logic of the function involves using a `WHILE` loop to check each character in the input string against `CX`.\n  - If a character to be removed is found, it is deleted from `CLEAN`, and the string length is adjusted accordingly.\n  - Ultimately, the function returns the cleaned string with none of the characters present in `CX`.\n\n- Output\n  - The function returns a string that is the result of removing all characters from `IN` that are present in `CX`.", "name": "CLEAN"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `OCT_TO_DWORD`, is designed to convert a string representing an octal number into a double-word (DWORD) integer. It works by parsing the string character by character, converting each character to its corresponding octal value, and then combining them into the final numerical value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `OCT`, a string of length 20 representing the octal number.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the string, used to access each character sequentially.\n    - `i`: A loop counter for iterating through the string.\n    - `x`: The ASCII value of the current character.\n    - `stop`: The length of the string, used to control the loop iterations.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization:\n    First, the pointer `pt` is set to the starting address of the input string `OCT`, and the string length is calculated and stored in `stop`.\n  \n  -- REGION Loop Processing:\n    A `FOR` loop is used to traverse each character in the string:\n    - The ASCII value of the current character is stored in variable `x`.\n    - It checks whether `x` falls between the character '0' (ASCII value 48) and '7' (ASCII value 55). If so, the character is a valid octal digit.\n    - The current value of `OCT_TO_DWORD` is left-shifted by 3 bits (equivalent to multiplying by 8), and the numerical value of the current character (`x - 48`) is added to update `OCT_TO_DWORD`.\n    - The pointer `pt` is moved to the next character's position.\n\n  -- REGION Conclusion:\n    After the loop completes, the function returns `OCT_TO_DWORD`, which is the converted double-word integer.\n\n- Summary\nThis function parses the string character by character, converts each valid octal character to its numerical value, and combines them through left-shifting and addition operations to form the final octal number. It is suitable for converting octal strings into integers for subsequent numerical processing.", "name": "OCT_TO_DWORD"}

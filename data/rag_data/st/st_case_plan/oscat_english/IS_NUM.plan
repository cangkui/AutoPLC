{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `IS_NUM` and is used to determine whether the input string consists entirely of numeric characters. If it does, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `str`, representing the input string, of type `STRING`, with a specified length.\n - Local variables:\n   - `L`, used to store the length of the string, of type `INT`.\n   - `pt`, a pointer of type `BYTE`, used to traverse each character in the string.\n   - `pos`, used to indicate the current position of the character being traversed, of type `INT`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, the pointer `pt` is set to point to the starting address of the input string `str`, obtained via `ADR(str)`. Then, the length of the string is retrieved using `LEN(str)` and stored in the variable `L`.\n\n-- REGION String Traversal\n   A `FOR` loop is used to traverse each character from 1 to the string length `L`:\n   - In each iteration, the function `ISC_NUM(pt^)` is used to check whether the character currently pointed to by `pt` is a numeric character. `ISC_NUM` is a hypothetical function that determines if a character is numeric.\n   - If the current character is not numeric, `IS_NUM` is set to `FALSE`, and the function immediately ends via `RETURN`.\n   - If the current character is numeric, the pointer `pt` is moved one position forward (`PT := PT + 1`) to continue checking the next character.\n\n-- REGION Result Return\n   If the loop completes and all characters are numeric, the string length `L` is checked to see if it is greater than 0. If `L > 0`, `IS_NUM` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the string consists entirely of numeric characters. If `L = 0`, `IS_NUM` is set to `FALSE`, indicating the string is empty.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function ultimately returns the value of `IS_NUM`, indicating whether the input string consists entirely of numeric characters.", "name": "IS_NUM"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `SDD`, calculates the Saturation Vapor Pressure based on the input temperature `T` and a boolean value `ICE`. If `ICE` is true, it uses the saturation vapor pressure formula for ice; if `ICE` is false, it uses the formula for water.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `T` represents temperature (in degrees Celsius), and `ICE` is a boolean indicating whether to use the ice-surface calculation formula.\n  - Output variable: `SDD` is the return value of the function, representing the calculated saturation vapor pressure (in Pascals, Pa).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculate Saturation Vapor Pressure\n    The function's logic is straightforward, selecting different formulas based on the value of `ICE`:\n    - If `ICE` is true (i.e., calculating for ice surface), the formula used is:\n      ```\n      SDD = 611.153 * EXP(22.4433 * T / (272.186 + T))\n      ```\n      This is the saturation vapor pressure formula for ice.\n    - If `ICE` is false (i.e., calculating for water surface), the formula used is:\n      ```\n      SDD = 611.213 * EXP(17.5043 * T / (241.2 + T))\n      ```\n      This is the saturation vapor pressure formula for water.\n    Finally, the function returns the calculated `SDD` value.", "name": "SDD"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function named `CIRCLE_C`, used to calculate a value related to a circle. The function takes two real numbers, `Rx` and `Ax`, as input and outputs a real number `circle_C`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `Rx` and `Ax`, representing two real number inputs.\n - Output variable: `circle_C`, representing the calculated result.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function is very straightforward, directly computing the value of `circle_C` using the formula:\n```plaintext\ncircle_C := 1.7453293E-2 * Rx * Ax;\n```\nHere, `1.7453293E-2` is a constant (scientific notation for 0.017453293) used to multiply with `Rx` and `Ax` to obtain the final result.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns `circle_C`, which is the result of the above calculation.", "name": "CIRCLE_C"}

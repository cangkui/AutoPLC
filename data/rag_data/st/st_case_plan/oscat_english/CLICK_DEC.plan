{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a functional block named `CLICK_DEC`, designed to detect the number of clicks on the input signal `IN` and output corresponding Boolean signals `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` based on the click count. It uses a timer `TP` to limit the time interval between clicks and a counter `cnt` to record the number of clicks.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` (input signal) and `TC` (timer time value).\n - Output variables: `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` (output signals representing the click count).\n - Internal variables: `tx` (timer instance), `edge` (used to detect the rising edge of the input signal), and `cnt` (counter, initialized to -1).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Input Signal Processing\n   First, if the input signal `IN` is `FALSE`, all output signals `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` are reset to `FALSE`. This ensures that the output signals remain inactive when there is no input signal.\n\n-- REGION Click Count Detection\n   If the input signal `IN` is `TRUE`, and a rising edge is detected (i.e., `edge` is `FALSE`), while the timer `tx` output `Q` is `FALSE`, the counter `cnt` is initialized to 0, indicating the start of click counting.\n\n   If the timer `tx` output `Q` is `TRUE`, and the input signal `IN` is `FALSE`, while a falling edge is detected (i.e., `edge` is `TRUE`), the counter `cnt` is incremented by 1, representing a recorded click.\n\n   If the timer `tx` output `Q` is `FALSE`, the corresponding output signal is set based on the current counter value `cnt`:\n   - If `cnt` is 0, set `Q0` to `TRUE`.\n   - If `cnt` is 1, set `Q1` to `TRUE`.\n   - If `cnt` is 2, set `Q2` to `TRUE`.\n   - If `cnt` is 3, set `Q3` to `TRUE`.\n   The counter `cnt` is then reset to -1, indicating the completion of click detection.\n\n-- REGION Edge Detection and Timer Update\n   Use `edge := IN` to detect the rising and falling edges of the input signal. Simultaneously, the timer `tx` is called, passing the input signal `IN` and the timer time value `TC` to the timer instance.\n\n- Summary\nThis functional block detects the number of clicks on the input signal and outputs corresponding signals based on the click count. It uses a timer to limit the time interval between clicks and a counter to record the click count. After each click is completed, the counter sets the corresponding output signal based on the click count and resets the counter to prepare for the next detection.", "name": "CLICK_DEC"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `_ARRAY_MUL`, designed to multiply each element in an array by a real number `X`. The function directly modifies the values in the array through pointer operations and returns a boolean value `TRUE` to indicate successful completion of the operation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `pt` is a pointer to an array of real numbers, `size` is the size of the array, and `X` is a real number used to multiply each element in the array.\n  - Internal variables: `i` is a loop counter, and `stop` is the termination condition for the loop.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the termination condition `stop` for the loop is calculated. By right-shifting `size` by 2 bits (equivalent to dividing by 4) and subtracting 1, the ending index for the loop is obtained. This is because array indices start at 0, and the loop needs to process `size/4` elements.\n\n  -- REGION Loop Processing\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through the first `stop` elements of the array. In each iteration, the `i`-th element of the array pointed to by `pt` is multiplied by `X`, and the result is stored back in the array. This direct pointer operation modifies the array values in place, avoiding additional memory overhead.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    After the loop completes, the function returns `TRUE`, indicating that the array multiplication operation was successfully executed.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently multiplies each element in an array by a real number using pointer operations and a loop. By directly modifying the array values, it eliminates the need for extra memory allocation and data copying. The function ultimately returns `TRUE` to confirm the operation's success.", "name": "_ARRAY_MUL"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function block named 'INC', designed to calculate an incremented value. It takes three input variables (X, D, M) and returns an integer value. The core logic of the function involves performing addition operations on the input values and using modulo arithmetic to ensure the result falls within a specified range.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: X (base value), D (increment value), M (modulus)\n - Output variable: INC (computed result)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Calculate Incremented Value\n   - The core logic of the function computes the expression `(X + D + M + 1) MOD (M + 1)`.\n   - First, the input values X, D, and M are summed, and 1 is added.\n   - Then, the modulo operation `MOD` is applied to constrain the result within the range of `0` to `M` (since the modulus is `M + 1`).\n   - Finally, the computed result is assigned to the output variable `INC`.\n-- END_REGION\n\n- Example\nAssume the input values are `X = 5`, `D = 3`, `M = 7`. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n1. `X + D + M + 1 = 5 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 16`\n2. `16 MOD (7 + 1) = 16 MOD 8 = 0`\nThus, the output value `INC` is `0`.\n\n- Summary\nThe primary purpose of this function is to compute an incremented value based on the input values and ensure the result stays within a specified range via modulo arithmetic. It can be used in scenarios requiring cyclic increments, such as counters or index calculations.", "name": "INC"}

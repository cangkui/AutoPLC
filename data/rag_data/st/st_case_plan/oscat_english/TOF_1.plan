{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block is named `TOF_1` and implements a Turn-Off Delay Timer (TOF). When the input signal `IN` transitions from true to false, the timer starts counting, and the output `Q` will turn false only after the delay time `PT` has elapsed. If the `RST` signal is true, the output `Q` is immediately set to false.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` (trigger signal), `PT` (delay time), `RST` (reset signal)\n - Output variable: `Q` (timer output)\n - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `start` (timer start time)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   - First, the current time is obtained via `DWORD_TO_TIME(T_PLC_MS())` and assigned to `tx`.\n   - If the `RST` signal is true, the output `Q` is immediately set to false, indicating a timer reset.\n   - If the `IN` signal is true, the output `Q` is set to true, and the current time `tx` is recorded as the timer start time `start`.\n   - If the `IN` signal is false and the difference between the current time `tx` and the timer start time `start` is greater than or equal to the delay time `PT`, the output `Q` is set to false, indicating the delay has ended.\n   - This logic achieves the Turn-Off Delay Timer functionality through straightforward conditional checks.\n\n- Summary\nThe `TOF_1` function block monitors changes in the input signal `IN` and, in combination with the delay time `PT` and reset signal `RST`, implements the turn-off delay function. When the `IN` signal transitions from true to false, the output `Q` remains true until the delay time `PT` expires. If the `RST` signal is true, the delay is immediately terminated, and `Q` is set to false. This function block is suitable for applications requiring delayed shutdown.", "name": "TOF_1"}

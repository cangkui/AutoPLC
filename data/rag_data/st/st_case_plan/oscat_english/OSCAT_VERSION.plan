{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `OSCAT_VERSION` that returns a DWORD value representing the version of the OSCAT library. The function determines the version number to return based on the state of the input signal `IN`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BOOL`, used to control the returned version number.\n  - Output variable: `OSCAT_VERSION`, of type `DWORD`, representing the version number of the OSCAT library.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The function's logic is very straightforward:\n    - If the input `IN` is `TRUE`, it returns a DWORD value converted from a date, representing the version date of the OSCAT library (`D#2024-07-16`).\n    - If the input `IN` is `FALSE`, it returns a fixed DWORD value `335`, representing the version number of the OSCAT library.\n    This design allows users to dynamically select the version information to return via the input signal `IN`, likely to provide different version identifiers for different application scenarios.", "name": "OSCAT_VERSION"}

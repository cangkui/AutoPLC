{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `RES_SI`, is used to calculate the resistance value based on temperature changes. It takes three input parameters: current temperature `T`, reference resistance `RS`, and reference temperature `TS`. The function returns a `REAL` value representing the resistance at the current temperature.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `T` (current temperature), `RS` (reference resistance), `TS` (reference temperature).\n  - Constants: `A` and `B`, used to calculate the temperature coefficient of resistance.\n  - Internal variable: `TX`, which stores the temperature difference (`T - TS`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Temperature Difference\n    First, compute the difference between the current temperature `T` and the reference temperature `TS`, storing the result in the internal variable `TX`.\n    ```plaintext\n    TX := T - TS;\n    ```\n\n  -- REGION Calculate Resistance Value\n    Use the following formula to calculate the resistance value `RES_SI` at the current temperature:\n    ```plaintext\n    RES_SI := RS * (1.0 + A * TX + B * TX * TX);\n    ```\n    In the formula:\n    - `RS` is the reference resistance value.\n    - `A` and `B` are temperature coefficient constants.\n    - `TX` is the temperature difference.\n    The formula uses the linear term `A * TX` and the quadratic term `B * TX * TX` to model the relationship between resistance and temperature changes.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    Finally, the function returns the calculated resistance value `RES_SI`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function uses a simple mathematical formula to simulate how resistance changes with temperature, making it suitable for scenarios where resistance values need to be adjusted based on temperature. The linear and quadratic terms in the formula provide high-precision compensation for temperature variations.", "name": "RES_SI"}

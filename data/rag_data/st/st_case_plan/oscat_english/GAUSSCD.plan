{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `GAUSSCD`, which calculates the value of the Gaussian Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The Gaussian CDF is a commonly used function in probability theory and statistics, describing the probability that a random variable in a normal distribution is less than or equal to a given value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `X`: Real type, representing the value for which the cumulative probability is to be calculated.\n    - `U`: Real type, representing the mean (expected value) of the normal distribution.\n    - `SI`: Real type, representing the standard deviation of the normal distribution.\n  - Output Variable:\n    - `GAUSSCD`: Real type, representing the value of the Gaussian CDF, i.e., the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to `X`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Compute Gaussian Cumulative Distribution Function\n    The core logic of this function involves calculating the Gaussian CDF value by invoking the error function `ERF`. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Compute `(X - U) / (SI * 1.414213562)`, where `1.414213562` is an approximation of `âˆš2`. This step standardizes the input value `X` to conform to the standard normal distribution.\n    2. Call the `ERF` function to calculate the error function value of the standardized value. The error function `ERF` is a key component of the Gaussian distribution, used to compute the probability of a random variable falling within a certain interval in the standard normal distribution.\n    3. Add `1.0` to the result of `ERF` and multiply by `0.5` to convert it into a CDF value. This step transforms the range of the error function from `[-1, 1]` to `[0, 1]`, aligning with the definition of probability.\n    4. Assign the computed result to the output variable `GAUSSCD`, which serves as the return value of the function.", "name": "GAUSSCD"}

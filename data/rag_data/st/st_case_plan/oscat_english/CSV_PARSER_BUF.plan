{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a CSV parser function block named 'CSV_PARSER_BUF'. Its main purpose is to parse CSV-formatted data from a network buffer and extract the data into string variables based on a delimiter. The function block controls the parsing process using a state machine and outputs the parsing results.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `SEP`, which represents the delimiter for CSV data.\n  - Input/output variables: `RUN`, which controls the start and stop of the parser; `OFFSET`, which indicates the current parsing offset; `VALUE`, which stores the parsed string; `PT`, a reference to the network buffer.\n  - Output variables: `RESULT`, which indicates the status of the parsing result.\n  - Internal variables: `step`, `size`, `c`, `v_add`, `i`, `state`, `eof`, `pv`, `pve`, `watchdog`, `x`. These variables are used to control the state and logic of the parsing process.\n\n- - Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    When `RUN` is greater than 0, the parser starts working. First, it checks if `state` is 0 (initial state). If so, it performs initialization operations:\n    - `pv` points to the starting address of the `VALUE` string and clears its content (`pv^ := 0`), indicating an empty string.\n    - `pve` points to the end address of the `VALUE` string (`pv + OSCAT_BASIC.STRING_LENGTH`), limiting the string length.\n    - `i` is set to the current offset `OFFSET`, indicating where to start parsing in the buffer.\n    - `size` is set to the network buffer length minus 1 (`PT.SIZE - 1`), representing the maximum index of the buffer.\n    - `RESULT` is initialized to 0, indicating the parser has not yet completed parsing.\n    - `state` is set to 5, indicating the parser enters the parsing state.\n    - `step` is initialized to 0, recording the parsing step (though unused in the code).\n\n  -- REGION Parsing Process\n    During parsing, a `watchdog` timer is used to prevent infinite loops. The `watchdog` timeout is set to 1 millisecond.\n    When `state` is 5, the parsing loop begins:\n    - First, `watchdog()` is called to check for timeout. If it times out (`watchdog.Q` is `TRUE`), the current state is maintained, and the loop exits to prevent the parser from getting stuck.\n    - It checks if the current offset `i` exceeds the buffer size (`i > size`). If so, `state` is set to 10, indicating parsing is complete, and the loop exits.\n    - The current character `c` (`PT.BUFFER[i]`) is read from the buffer, and it checks if it is the last character (`eof := i + 1 = PT.SIZE`).\n    - Based on the value of `c`, logic is applied:\n      - If `c` equals the delimiter `SEP`, `state` is set to 1, indicating a complete field is parsed, and `x` is set to `TRUE`.\n      - If `c` is a printable character (ASCII code >= 32), it is added to the `VALUE` string (`v_add := c`). If `c` is the last character, `state` is set to 2, indicating parsing is complete; otherwise, `x` is set to `TRUE`.\n      - If `c` is a non-printable character and `x` is `TRUE`, `state` is set to 2, indicating parsing is complete, and `x` is reset to `FALSE`.\n    - If the character `c` is successfully added to the `VALUE` string (`v_add > 0` and `pv < pve`), the `pv` pointer is updated (`pv^ := v_add`), and parsing continues. Finally, the character pointed to by `pv` is set to 0, indicating the end of the string.\n    - The offset `i` is incremented (`i := i + 1`), and parsing continues with the next character.\n\n  -- REGION State Handling\n    After parsing, different actions are taken based on the value of `state`:\n    - If `state` is 1, indicating a complete field is parsed:\n      - `RESULT` is set to 1, indicating successful parsing of a field.\n      - `OFFSET` is updated to the current offset `i` for the next parsing session.\n      - The parser is stopped (`RUN := 0`).\n      - `state` is reset to 0, preparing for the next parsing session.\n    - If `state` is 2, indicating parsing is complete:\n      - `RESULT` is set to 2, indicating parsing is complete.\n      - `OFFSET` is updated to the current offset `i`.\n      - The parser is stopped (`RUN := 0`).\n      - `state` is reset to 0, preparing for the next parsing session.\n    - If `state` is 5, indicating parsing is still in progress:\n      - `RESULT` is set to 5, indicating parsing is ongoing.\n    - If `state` is 10, indicating parsing is complete with no more data:\n      - `RESULT` is set to 10, indicating parsing is complete.\n      - `OFFSET` is updated to the current offset `i`.\n      - The parser is stopped (`RUN := 0`).\n      - `state` is reset to 0, preparing for the next parsing session.\n\n  -- REGION Completion\n    After parsing is complete, the function block updates the output variable `RESULT` based on the parsing result and stops the parser (`RUN` is set to 0). The parser can be restarted to continue parsing remaining data.", "name": "CSV_PARSER_BUF"}

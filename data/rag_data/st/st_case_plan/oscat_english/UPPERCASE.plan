{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `UPPERCASE`, which converts an input string to uppercase letters and returns it. The function achieves this by iterating through each character in the string and converting it to uppercase.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the input string.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`, a pointer to a byte, used to traverse the characters in the string.\n    - `pos`, an integer indicating the current character position being processed.\n    - `l`, an integer representing the length of the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - First, the pointer `pt` is initialized to point to the address of the output string `UPPERCASE`.\n     - The input string `str` is copied into the output string `UPPERCASE`.\n     - The `LEN` function is used to get the length of the input string, which is stored in the variable `l`.\n  \n  -- REGION Character Processing\n     - A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string:\n       - Starting from position 1 up to the string length `l`.\n       - In each iteration, the `TO_UPPER` function converts the character pointed to by `pt` to uppercase.\n       - The pointer `pt` is then moved one byte forward to process the next character.\n  \n  -- REGION Output Result\n     - After the loop completes, all characters in the output string `UPPERCASE` have been converted to uppercase, and the function returns this string.", "name": "UPPERCASE"}

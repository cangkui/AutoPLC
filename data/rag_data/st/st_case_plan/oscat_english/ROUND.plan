{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `ROUND` and is used to perform rounding operations on input real numbers, retaining a specified number of decimal places. The function takes two inputs: a real number `in` and an integer `N`, representing the number of decimal places to retain. The function adjusts the precision of the input value to achieve rounding.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` is the real number to be rounded, and `N` is the number of decimal places to retain.\n  - Internal variables: `X` is a real number used to store the precision adjustment factor calculated based on `N`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Logic Processing\n      1. **Precision Adjustment Factor Calculation**:\n         - Use `setup.DECADES[LIMIT(0,N,8)]` to obtain a precision adjustment factor `X` related to `N`. `LIMIT(0,N,8)` ensures that the value of `N` is between 0 and 8 to prevent out-of-bounds errors.\n         - `setup.DECADES` is a predefined array storing powers of 10 (e.g., 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.) used for precision adjustment.\n      \n      2. **Rounding Operation**:\n         - Multiply the input value `in` by `X`, then convert it to an integer (using `REAL_TO_DINT`) and back to a real number (using `DINT_TO_REAL`).\n         - Divide the result by `X` to obtain the rounded value.\n      \n      3. **Return Result**:\n         - Assign the rounded value to `ROUND`, which serves as the function's return value.\n\n- Example Explanation\n  For example, if `in = 3.14159` and `N = 2`, then:\n  - `X = 100` (since 2 decimal places are retained, `setup.DECADES[2] = 100`).\n  - `in * X = 314.159`.\n  - `REAL_TO_DINT(314.159) = 314` (truncating the decimal part).\n  - `DINT_TO_REAL(314) = 314.0`.\n  - `314.0 / 100 = 3.14`, which is the rounded result.\n\n- Notes\n  - `LIMIT(0,N,8)` ensures that `N` is between 0 and 8 to avoid array out-of-bounds errors.\n  - The function supports retaining up to 8 decimal places due to the length limitation of the `setup.DECADES` array.\n  - Since `REAL_TO_DINT` is used for truncation, the function effectively implements 'rounding to the nearest integer' rather than strict mathematical rounding.", "name": "ROUND"}

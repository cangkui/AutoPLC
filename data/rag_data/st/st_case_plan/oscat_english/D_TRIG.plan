{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block `D_TRIG` designed to detect changes in the input signal `in`. When the input signal changes, the output `Q` becomes `TRUE`, and the output `X` displays the magnitude of the input signal change. The function block achieves this by comparing the current input value with the input value from the previous cycle.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `in`, representing the current input signal, of type `DWORD`.\n  - Output variables:\n    - `Q`, indicating whether the input signal has changed, of type `BOOL`.\n    - `X`, representing the magnitude of the input signal change, of type `DWORD`.\n  - Internal variable: `last_in`, used to store the input signal value from the previous cycle, of type `DWORD`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The logic of the function block is very simple and consists of the following three steps:\n    1. **Detect Input Signal Change**: By comparing the current input signal `in` with the previous cycle's input signal `last_in`, it determines whether the input signal has changed. If `in` is not equal to `last_in`, `Q` outputs `TRUE`; otherwise, it outputs `FALSE`.\n    2. **Calculate Input Signal Change Magnitude**: The change in the input signal is calculated by subtracting the previous cycle's input signal `last_in` from the current input signal `in`, and the result is assigned to the output variable `X`.\n    3. **Update Previous Cycle's Input Signal**: The current input signal `in` is stored in `last_in` for comparison in the next cycle.\n\n  The overall purpose of this logic is to detect changes in the input signal and output both the change status and the magnitude of the change.", "name": "D_TRIG"}

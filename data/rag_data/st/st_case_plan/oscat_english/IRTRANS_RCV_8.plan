{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a functional block named `IRTRANS_RCV_8` designed for infrared reception and decoding. Its primary function is to determine whether the currently received infrared signal matches the input device code and key codes, then output the corresponding Boolean values.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `dev_code` (device code), `key_code_0` to `key_code_7` (8 key codes), and `CMD` (command signal).\n  - Input/output variables: `DEV` (current device code) and `KEY` (current key code).\n  - Output variables: `Q0` to `Q7` (8 Boolean outputs, each corresponding to the matching result of a key code).\n  - Temporary variable: `decode` (decoding flag, used to determine if the device code matches).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Decoding Logic\n     This region implements the core logic for infrared signal decoding:\n     1. **Decoding Flag Calculation**: First, the decoding flag is computed via `decode := cmd AND dev_code = dev`. If `CMD` is true and `dev_code` matches `DEV`, then `decode` is true, indicating a device code match.\n     2. **Key Code Matching**: Based on the match between `KEY` and `key_code_0` to `key_code_7`, combined with the decoding flag `decode`, the outputs `Q0` to `Q7` are calculated. If `KEY` matches a key code and `decode` is true, the corresponding output is true; otherwise, it is false.\n     - `Q0 := key = key_code_0 AND decode;`\n     - `Q1 := key = key_code_1 AND decode;`\n     - `Q2 := key = key_code_2 AND decode;`\n     - `Q3 := key = key_code_3 AND decode;`\n     - `Q4 := key = key_code_4 AND decode;`\n     - `Q5 := key = key_code_5 AND decode;`\n     - `Q6 := key = key_code_6 AND decode;`\n     - `Q7 := key = key_code_7 AND decode;`\n\n  The logic of this functional block is very straightforward, primarily used for matching device codes and key codes in infrared signals and outputting the corresponding matching results.", "name": "IRTRANS_RCV_8"}

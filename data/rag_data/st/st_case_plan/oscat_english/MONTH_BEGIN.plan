{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `MONTH_BEGIN`, is designed to calculate the first day of the month for a given date. It takes a `DATE` type input parameter `idate` and returns the first day of the month corresponding to that date.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `idate`, representing the input date.\n  - Return value: `MONTH_BEGIN`, representing the calculated first day of the month.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function calculates the first day of the month through the following steps:\n  1. Use `DAY_OF_MONTH(idate)` to get the day of the month for the input date.\n  2. Subtract 1 from the day to get the number of days difference from the first day of the month.\n  3. Convert the days difference to seconds (multiply by 86400, since there are 86400 seconds in a day).\n  4. Convert the input date to a DWORD type, subtract the calculated seconds, and obtain the DWORD value for the first day of the month.\n  5. Convert the DWORD value back to a DATE type, which is returned as the function's result.\n\n  For example, if the input date is `2023-10-15`:\n  - `DAY_OF_MONTH(idate)` returns 15.\n  - Calculate `15 - 1 = 14`, representing 14 days from the first day of the month.\n  - Convert 14 days to seconds: `14 * 86400 = 1209600`.\n  - Convert the input date `2023-10-15` to a DWORD value, assumed to be `1697308800` (specific value depends on date conversion rules).\n  - Subtract 1209600 seconds to get `1696099200`.\n  - Convert `1696099200` back to a DATE type, resulting in `2023-10-01`, the first day of the month.\n\n  Finally, the function returns `2023-10-01`.\n\n-- REGION End\nThe function logic is simple and efficient, quickly determining the first day of the month through date and time conversion and calculations.", "name": "MONTH_BEGIN"}

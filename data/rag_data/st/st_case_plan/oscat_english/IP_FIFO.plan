{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'IP_FIFO', designed to implement a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. It manages data storage and retrieval by controlling the read/write pointers and queue status.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output variables: FIFO (queue data), ID (identifier), STATE (status)\n - Internal variables: tmp (temporary variable)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This section initializes the FIFO queue. If the INIT flag of FIFO is false, initialization is performed, including setting the read/write pointers (NW and NR) to 1, setting the EMPTY flag to true, the FULL flag to false, defining the queue's top (TOP) as 128, and setting the maximum ID (MAX_ID) to 1.\n\n-- REGION ID Handling\n   This section processes ID logic. If the ID is 0, it checks whether the current FIFO ID is less than the queue's top. If true, it increments the ID and updates the FIFO ID. If the ID has reached the queue's top and the state is less than 200, the state is set to 255 and the function returns.\n\n-- REGION Data Writing\n   This section handles data writing. If the state is 1 and the queue is not full, data is written to the queue. First, the ID is converted to an integer, and the corresponding Y array is checked to see if it is less than the maximum ID. If true, the Y array value is incremented, and the ID is stored in the X array. The write pointer (NW) is then updated. If the write pointer reaches the queue's top, it is reset to 1. Finally, the FULL and EMPTY flags are updated, and the state is set to 2.\n\n-- REGION Data Reading\n   This section handles data reading. If the state is 2 and the queue is not empty, it checks whether the ID at the current read pointer (NR) matches the input ID. If they match, the state is set to 3.\n\n-- REGION Data Deletion\n   This section handles data deletion. If the state is 4 and the queue is not empty, it checks whether the ID at the current read pointer (NR) matches the input ID. If they match, the Y array value is decremented, and the read pointer (NR) is updated. If the read pointer reaches the queue's top, it is reset to 1. Finally, the FULL and EMPTY flags are updated, and the state is set to 5.\n\n-- REGION Completion\n   This section concludes the function block execution.", "name": "IP_FIFO"}

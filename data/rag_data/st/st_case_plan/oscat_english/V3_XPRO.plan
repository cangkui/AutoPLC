{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `V3_XPRO` to calculate the cross product of two 3D vectors (`A` and `B`). The cross product is a crucial operation in vector mathematics, resulting in a new vector that is perpendicular to the two input vectors.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `A` and `B`, both of type `Vector_3`, representing the two input 3D vectors.\n - Output variable: The function returns a `Vector_3` type vector, representing the result of the cross product.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Cross Product Calculation\n   This region implements the cross product calculation logic. The formulas for the cross product are as follows:\n   - X-component of the result vector: `V3_XPRO.X := A.Y * B.Z - A.Z * B.Y`\n   - Y-component of the result vector: `V3_XPRO.Y := A.Z * B.X - A.X * B.Z`\n   - Z-component of the result vector: `V3_XPRO.Z := A.X * B.Y - A.Y * B.X`\n   These formulas directly implement the mathematical definition of the cross product. The final returned vector is the cross product of the input vectors `A` and `B`.", "name": "V3_XPRO"}

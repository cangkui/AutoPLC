{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `WINDOW` that checks whether the input value `in` falls within the specified lower bound `low` and upper bound `high`. If `in` is between `low` and `high`, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines three types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `low` (lower bound, type `REAL`), `in` (input value, type `REAL`), `high` (upper bound, type `REAL`).\n  - Output variable: `WINDOW` (a boolean value indicating whether the input is within the specified range).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function is very simple. It uses a boolean expression `in < high AND in > low` to determine if the input value `in` lies between `low` and `high`. If the condition is met, `WINDOW` is assigned `TRUE`; otherwise, it is assigned `FALSE`.", "name": "WINDOW"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `GEN_RDT`, which generates a pulse signal with random time intervals. The block triggers an output signal after a random delay (within a specified minimum and maximum time range), and the duration of the output signal is controlled by the `TP_Q` parameter.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `Enable` (enable signal), `Min_Time_ms` (minimum time interval), `Max_Time_ms` (maximum time interval), `TP_Q` (output signal duration).\n - Output variables: `xQ` (output signal).\n - Internal variables: `tonRDMTimer` (timer for generating random delays), `tof_xQ` (timer for controlling output signal duration), `tRDMTime` (random delay time), `rRDMTime` (random value used to calculate the random delay time).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Timer Logic\n    - `tonRDMTimer` is a `TON` (Timer On Delay) timer used to generate random delay times. Its input `IN` is controlled by `Enable`, and its preset time `PT` is determined by `tRDMTime`.\n    - `tof_xQ` is a `TOF` (Timer Off Delay) timer used to control the duration of the output signal `xQ`. Its input `IN` is controlled by `tonRDMTimer.Q` (the output of `tonRDMTimer`), and its preset time `PT` is determined by `TP_Q`.\n    - The output signal `xQ` is directly controlled by `tof_xQ.Q` (the output of `tof_xQ`).\n\n-- REGION Random Time Generation Logic\n    - When `tonRDMTimer.Q` is `TRUE`, it indicates the timer has completed its countdown. At this point:\n        - The output signal `xQ` is set to `TRUE`.\n        - The `RDM` function is called to generate a new random value `rRDMTime`, which is based on the previous random value.\n        - A new random delay time `tRDMTime` is calculated using `rRDMTime` with the formula:\n          ```plaintext\n          tRDMTime = REAL_TO_TIME(rRDMTime * (Max_Time_ms - Min_Time_ms) + Min_Time_ms)\n          ```\n          Here, `Max_Time_ms` and `Min_Time_ms` define the maximum and minimum bounds for the random delay time.\n        - The input `IN` of `tonRDMTimer` is reset to `FALSE` to restart the timer.\n\n- Output Result\nThe output signal `xQ` is a pulse signal with random trigger intervals (between `Min_Time_ms` and `Max_Time_ms`). Each time it is triggered, the output signal remains active for the duration specified by `TP_Q`.", "name": "GEN_RDT"}

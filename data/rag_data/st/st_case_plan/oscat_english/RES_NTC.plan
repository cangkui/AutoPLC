{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `RES_NTC`, which calculates the resistance value of a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor at a given temperature. The resistance of an NTC decreases as temperature rises, and this relationship can be described using an exponential formula.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `T`: Temperature value in degrees Celsius (°C).\n    - `RN`: Nominal resistance value of the NTC at a reference temperature.\n    - `B`: Material constant of the NTC, typically provided by the manufacturer.\n  - Output variable:\n    - `RES_NTC`: The calculated resistance value of the NTC at the given temperature.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating NTC Resistance:\n    The core logic of the function uses an exponential formula to compute the NTC's resistance. The formula is:\n    ```\n    RES_NTC := RN * EXP(B * (1.0 / (T + 273.15) - 0.00335401643468053))\n    ```\n    Where:\n    - `T + 273.15`: Converts Celsius to Kelvin (K), as thermodynamic temperature calculations require Kelvin units.\n    - `1.0 / (T + 273.15)`: Computes the reciprocal of the current temperature.\n    - `0.00335401643468053`: The reciprocal of the reference temperature (typically 25°C, or 298.15K), used for normalization.\n    - `B * (1.0 / (T + 273.15) - 0.00335401643468053)`: Calculates the effect of temperature change on resistance.\n    - `EXP(...)`: The exponential function, describing the nonlinear relationship between NTC resistance and temperature.\n    - `RN * EXP(...)`: Multiplies the nominal resistance `RN` by the exponential term to obtain the resistance at the current temperature.\n\n    Finally, the calculated resistance value is assigned to the output variable `RES_NTC` and returned as the function's result.", "name": "RES_NTC"}

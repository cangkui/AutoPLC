{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function named `F_TO_OM` that converts frequency `F` (in Hertz) to angular frequency `OM` (in radians per second). The angular frequency is 2π times the frequency.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `F`, representing frequency, of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n  - Output variable: `F_TO_OM`, representing angular frequency, of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The function's logic is very straightforward. It directly uses the formula `F_TO_OM := math.PI2 * F` to convert frequency to angular frequency. Here, `math.PI2` is a constant representing 2π (approximately 6.283185307).\n     This formula is based on the definition of angular frequency in physics, where the relationship between angular frequency (ω) and frequency (f) is: ω = 2πf.\n     The function has no complex control logic or state machine—it simply performs a single calculation and returns the result.\n\n- Output Result\nThe output of the function is the computed angular frequency `F_TO_OM`, of type `REAL`.", "name": "F_TO_OM"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `ATANH`, which calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent (Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent) of an input value `X`. The inverse hyperbolic tangent function is the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent function and is commonly used in mathematical and engineering computations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, represents the input value for the function. It must lie within the interval `(-1, 1)` because the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is defined only within this range.\n - Output variable: `ATANH`, of type `REAL`, represents the computed result, i.e., the inverse hyperbolic tangent value of the input `X`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Compute Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent\n   The function's logic is based on the mathematical formula for the inverse hyperbolic tangent function:\n   \\[\n   \\text{atanh}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}\\right)\n   \\]\n   In the code, it first calculates `(1.0 + x) / (1.0 - x)`, then takes the natural logarithm (`LN`), and finally multiplies the result by `0.5` to obtain the inverse hyperbolic tangent value.\n\n   The specific steps are as follows:\n   1. Compute `(1.0 + x)` by adding the input value `X` to `1.0`.\n   2. Compute `(1.0 - x)` by subtracting the input value `X` from `1.0`.\n   3. Divide the result from step 1 by the result from step 2 to get `(1.0 + x) / (1.0 - x)`.\n   4. Take the natural logarithm (`LN`) of the result from step 3 to obtain `ln((1.0 + x) / (1.0 - x))`.\n   5. Multiply the result from step 4 by `0.5` to get the final inverse hyperbolic tangent value.\n   6. Assign the result to the output variable `ATANH`.\n\n   Note that the input value `X` must be within the interval `(-1, 1)`; otherwise, the computation will be invalid or result in an error, as the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is undefined outside this range.\nEND_REGION", "name": "ATANH"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `FIND_NUM` designed to locate the position of the first numeric character or decimal point character (ASCII value 46) in a given string `str`, starting from a specified position `pos`. If found, it returns the character's position; otherwise, it returns 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code includes the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `str` (a string with length `STRING_LENGTH`), `pos` (an integer representing the starting position for the search).\n  - Internal variables: `i` (loop counter), `pt` (a pointer to the string's byte array), `stop` (length of the string), `X` (ASCII value of the current character).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - `pt` is initialized to the address of the string `str` using `ADR(str)`.\n     - `stop` is initialized to the length of `str` using `LEN(str)`.\n  -- REGION Search Logic\n     - A `FOR` loop iterates through the string starting from `MAX(pos, 1)` up to `stop`. `MAX(pos, 1)` ensures the starting position is at least 1, avoiding invalid negative or zero values.\n     - Inside the loop, the pointer `pt` accesses the `i`-th character of the string, and its ASCII value is stored in `X`.\n     - Checks if `X` is a numeric character (ASCII value between 48 and 57) or a decimal point (ASCII value 46).\n     - If a matching character is found, its position `i` is returned immediately, and the function exits.\n  -- REGION Result Return\n     - If no matching character is found after the loop completes, the function returns 0, indicating no match.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently traverses a string from a specified position to find the first numeric or decimal point character. It uses direct pointer access to the string's byte array for improved performance. If the target character is found, its position is returned; otherwise, 0 is returned. This logic is useful for scenarios requiring number extraction or decimal point handling in strings.", "name": "FIND_NUM"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `_RMP_NEXT` is used to control the states of output signals `UP` and `DN` based on the input value `IN` and the trend of the current output value `OUT`, while adjusting the direction of the output value `OUT`. It also includes a locking mechanism to prevent output changes under specific conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `E` (enable signal, default value `TRUE`), `IN` (target value), `TR` (rise time), `TF` (fall time), `TL` (lock time).\n  - Output variables: `DIR` (direction, `TRUE` means rising), `UP` (rising signal), `DN` (falling signal).\n  - Input/output variable: `OUT` (current output value).\n  - Internal variables: `rmx` (function block for adjusting the output value), `dirx` (function block for detecting input trend), `t_lock` (function block for implementing the locking mechanism), `xen` (enable flag), `xdir` (direction flag).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Input Trend Detection\n     Uses the `dirx` function block to detect the trend of the input value `IN`. `dirx.TU` indicates the input value is rising, and `dirx.TD` indicates the input value is falling.\n\n  -- REGION Locking Mechanism\n     Uses the `t_lock` function block to implement the locking mechanism. When specific conditions are met, the lock timer is activated. The lock duration is determined by the `TL` parameter.\n\n  -- REGION Direction Control\n     Sets the direction flag `xdir` and enable flag `xen` based on the relationship between the input value `IN` and the current output value `OUT`:\n    - If the input value is rising and `OUT` is less than `IN`, `xdir` is set to `TRUE`, indicating an upward direction.\n    - If the input value is falling and `OUT` is greater than `IN`, `xdir` is set to `FALSE`, indicating a downward direction.\n    - If `OUT` reaches or exceeds the target value `IN`, the enable flag `xen` is cleared.\n\n  -- REGION Output Signal Control\n     If the lock timer is inactive and the enable flag `xen` is `TRUE`, the output signals are set based on the direction flag `xdir`:\n    - `UP` and `DIR` are set to the value of `xdir`.\n    - `DN` is set to `NOT xdir`.\n     Otherwise, `UP` and `DN` are set to `FALSE`, indicating no change.\n\n  -- REGION Output Value Adjustment\n     Uses the `rmx` function block to adjust the output value `OUT`. Based on the direction flag `DIR` and the enable signal `E`, `rmx` selects either the rise time `TR` or fall time `TF` to gradually adjust the value of `OUT`.", "name": "_RMP_NEXT"}

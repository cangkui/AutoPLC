{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block is named `BIT_LOAD_DW` and is used to set or clear a specific bit (`BIT`) in a double word (`DWORD`) at a specified position (`POS`). Based on the input value `VAL`, this function block can set a bit in `IN` to 1 or 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (DWORD, the data to be manipulated), `VAL` (Boolean, determines whether to set or clear the bit), `POS` (integer, specifies the position to operate on).\n  - Constant variable: `dat` (DWORD, value is 1, used for bit manipulation).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Bit Manipulation Logic\n     The core logic of the function block is to perform bit manipulation on `IN` based on the value of `VAL`:\n     - If `VAL` is `TRUE`, it uses the `OR` operation and the `SHL` (shift left) function to set the `POS`-th bit of `IN` to 1. Specifically, it shifts the constant `dat` (value 1) left by `POS` bits and then performs a bitwise OR operation with `IN`.\n     - If `VAL` is `FALSE`, it uses the `AND` operation and the `NOT` function to clear the `POS`-th bit of `IN` to 0. Specifically, it shifts the constant `dat` left by `POS` bits, inverts the result, and then performs a bitwise AND operation with `IN`.\n     Finally, the function block returns the manipulated result.\n\n- Output Result\n  The return value of the function block is a double word (`DWORD`), representing the result after setting or clearing the specified bit.", "name": "BIT_LOAD_DW"}

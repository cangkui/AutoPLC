{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `FADE`, which facilitates smooth transitions between two input values. It employs the `RMP_W` function block to achieve linear interpolation and controls the start and stop of the transition based on the input boolean signal `F` and the reset signal `rst`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input Variables**: `IN1` and `IN2` represent the starting and target values for the transition, `F` is the boolean signal to initiate the transition, `TF` is the transition time, and `rst` is the reset signal.\n  - **Output Variable**: `Y` is the current value after the transition.\n  - **Internal Variable**: `rmx` is an instance of the `RMP_W` function block, used to implement the linear transition.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function block is divided into two parts:\n    1. **Invoking the `RMP_W` Function Block**:\n       - `rmx` is an instance of `RMP_W`, generating a linear transition value from 0 to 65535.\n       - `rst AND NOT F` resets the transition process. When `rst` is true and `F` is false, `rmx` is reset.\n       - `rst AND F` starts the transition process. When `rst` is true and `F` is true, `rmx` begins generating transition values.\n       - `TF` is the transition time, representing the duration required to transition from 0 to 65535.\n       - `up := F` controls the transition direction. When `F` is true, `rmx` counts upward (from 0 to 65535); otherwise, counting stops.\n\n    2. **Calculating the Output `Y`**:\n       - `Y` is the current transition value, computed using the linear interpolation formula:\n         \\[\n         Y = \\frac{(IN2 - IN1)}{65535.0} \\times \\text{WORD\\_TO\\_REAL}(rmx.out) + IN1\n         \\]\n       - Here, `rmx.out` is the current transition value (an integer between 0 and 65535) generated by `RMP_W`, converted to a real number via `WORD_TO_REAL`.\n       - The formula maps `rmx.out` to a value between `IN1` and `IN2`, achieving a smooth transition.\n\n  -- REGION Output\n    - `Y` is the final output value, representing the real-time result of the current transition.", "name": "FADE"}

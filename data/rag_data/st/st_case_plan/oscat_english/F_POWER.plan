{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `F_POWER` used to calculate the result of a real number `a` multiplied by `x` raised to the power of `n`. The function utilizes the built-in `EXPT` function to perform the exponentiation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `a`: A real number serving as the multiplier.\n    - `x`: A real number serving as the base.\n    - `n`: A real number serving as the exponent.\n  - Output variable:\n    - `F_POWER`: The return value of the function, of type `REAL`, representing the calculation result.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Exponentiation Calculation\n     The core logic of the function involves calculating `x` raised to the power of `n` by calling `EXPT(X, N)`, then multiplying the result by `a`, and finally assigning the outcome to `F_POWER`. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Use `EXPT(X, N)` to compute `x` raised to the power of `n`.\n    2. Multiply the result by `a`.\n    3. Assign the final result to `F_POWER` as the function's return value.\n\n  Example:\n  If `a = 2.0`, `x = 3.0`, `n = 2.0`, the calculation process for `F_POWER` would be:\n  ```\n  F_POWER = 2.0 * EXPT(3.0, 2.0) = 2.0 * 9.0 = 18.0\n  ```", "name": "F_POWER"}

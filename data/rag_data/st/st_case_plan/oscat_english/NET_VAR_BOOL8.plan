{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `NET_VAR_BOOL8`, designed to handle network variable data. It takes boolean inputs (IN1 to IN8) and generates a byte stored in a buffer, or reads a byte from the buffer and decomposes it into boolean outputs (OUT1 to OUT8). The function block also includes error handling and state management logic.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: `X`, used to store network variable data, including buffer, state, error ID, etc.\n  - Input Variables: `IN1` to `IN8`, representing 8 boolean input values.\n  - Output Variables: `OUT1` to `OUT8`, representing 8 boolean output values; `ID`, representing the unique identifier of the current function block.\n  - Local Variables: `init`, used for initializing the function block; `index` and `index2`, used for managing buffer indices; `BYTE_TO_BITS`, used to decompose a byte into boolean values.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     On the first run of the function block, the `init` variable is false, triggering the initialization logic. First, `init` is set to true, then `X.ID_MAX` is incremented and converted to a byte type, assigned to `ID`. This assigns a unique identifier to the function block.\n\n  -- REGION Data Processing\n     If `X.STATE` is greater than 0 and `X.ERROR_ID` is 0, data processing begins. First, the value of `X.index` is retrieved, and buffer overflow is checked. If the index exceeds the buffer size, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current function block's `ID`, indicating an error.\n\n     If `X.STATE` is 1, the function block is in write mode. Here, `ID`, the fixed value `BYTE#4`, and the byte generated from the boolean inputs are sequentially written to the buffer. After writing, `X.index` is updated.\n\n     If `X.STATE` is 2, the function block is in read mode. Here, the `ID` and fixed value `BYTE#4` in the buffer are checked for a match. If they donâ€™t match, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current function block's `ID`, indicating an error. If they match, a byte is read from the buffer and decomposed into boolean values using `BYTE_TO_BITS`, assigned to `OUT1` to `OUT8`. After reading, `X.index` is updated.\n\n  -- REGION Error Handling\n     During data processing, if buffer overflow or data mismatch is detected, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current function block's `ID`, indicating an error. This can be used for subsequent error handling and debugging.", "name": "NET_VAR_BOOL8"}

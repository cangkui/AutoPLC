Multiply the input hours (`IN`) by `3600000` to convert hours to milliseconds. Since `1 hour = 3600 seconds` and `1 second = 1000 milliseconds`, then `1 hour = 3600 * 1000 = 3600000 milliseconds`.\n     2. Convert the result from `REAL` type to `DWORD` type using the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function.\n     3. Convert the `DWORD` type result to `TOD` type using the `DWORD_TO_TOD` function.\n     4. Assign the final result to the output variable `HOUR_TO_TOD`.\n\n     For example, if the input is `IN = 1.5`, the calculation process is as follows:\n     - `1.5 * 3600000 = 5400000` (representing 1.5 hours = 5,400,000 milliseconds).\n     - Convert `5400000` to `DWORD` type.\n     - Convert the `DWORD` result to `TOD` type, representing a time of 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\n     The core idea of this function is to represent time by converting hours to milliseconds and then converting that to the `TOD` type.",

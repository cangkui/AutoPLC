{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `HOUR`, which extracts the hour component from a `TIME_OF_DAY` type time value and returns it as an integer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `itod`, of type `TIME_OF_DAY`, representing a time of day.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   The core logic of the function extracts the hour component from the `TIME_OF_DAY` type time through the following steps:\n   1. Use the `TOD_TO_DWORD` function to convert the `TIME_OF_DAY` type time into a `DWORD` type, representing the number of milliseconds since midnight.\n   2. Divide the converted milliseconds by 3,600,000 (the number of milliseconds in one hour) to obtain the hour component.\n   3. Use the `DWORD_TO_INT` function to convert the result into an integer type and assign it to the output variable `HOUR`.\n   Finally, the function returns the value of `HOUR`, which is the hour component of the input time.", "name": "HOUR"}

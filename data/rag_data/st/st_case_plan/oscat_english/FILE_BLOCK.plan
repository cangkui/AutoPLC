{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block is named 'FILE_BLOCK' and is used for handling file operations. It employs a state machine (step) to control file reading operations. Depending on the value of MODE, the block performs different actions, including opening files, reading data, and handling errors.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: MODE (operation mode), FILENAME (file name), FSD (file server data), PT (network buffer)\n  - Input Variables: POS (file position)\n  - Output Variables: ERROR (error code), DATA (read data)\n  - Internal Variables: step (state machine step), i (temporary index), data_start (data start position), data_stop (data end position)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION State Machine Logic\n     The state machine controls the operation flow using the step variable, divided into two main steps: 0 and 10.\n\n     - step 0: File Read Preparation\n       When MODE is greater than 0, the block begins processing file read operations. First, it checks whether the file is open and if the file size is valid. If the file is not open or POS exceeds the file range, an error code is set, and the operation ends. If POS is within the valid range and the file is open, the data is read directly, and the operation ends. If POS is not within the current data buffer range, the file operation is reinitialized by setting the file name, mode, and offset, and the process moves to step 10.\n\n     - step 10: File Read Completion\n       When MODE is 0, it indicates the file read operation is complete. The block checks for any errors; if an error occurred, it sets the error code and ends the operation. If no errors are found, it updates the start and end positions of the data buffer and returns to step 0 to continue processing.\n\n   The state machine design ensures the block efficiently handles file read operations while managing potential errors. By controlling MODE and step, the block executes appropriate actions based on the current state, ensuring the correctness and efficiency of file reading.", "name": "FILE_BLOCK"}

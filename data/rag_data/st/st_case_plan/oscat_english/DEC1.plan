{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a function named `DEC1`, designed to decrement an input integer by one. Based on whether the input value `X` is zero, the function decides whether to directly decrement `X` by one or to decrement another input value `N` by one.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `X` and `N`, both of integer type.\n - Output variable: `DEC1`, also of integer type, representing the return value of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   The core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n   - If the input `X` equals 0, decrement `N` by one and assign the result to `DEC1`.\n   - Otherwise, decrement `X` by one and assign the result to `DEC1`.\n   The purpose of this logic is to choose different operation paths based on the value of `X`, ultimately returning an integer value decremented by one.", "name": "DEC1"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `FLOW_METER` is used to calculate flow rate. It computes the flow `F` based on the input velocity `VX` and enable signal `E`, supporting pulse mode and reset functionality. The flow calculation relies on an integrator `int1` and updates the output periodically according to the `UPDATE_TIME`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: velocity `VX`, enable signal `E`, reset signal `RST`, pulse mode `PULSE_MODE`, update time `UPDATE_TIME`.\n  - Output variable: flow rate `F`.\n  - Input/output variables: integral value `X` and counter `Y`.\n  - Internal variables: time variables `tx` and `tl`, integrator `int1`, initialization flag `init`, previous enable signal `e_last`, temporary variable `tmp`, and previous values of `X` and `Y` (`x_last` and `y_last`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     During the first execution of the function block, internal variables are initialized. `init` is set to `TRUE`, the current time `tl` is recorded, and the initial values of `X` and `Y` are saved. Additionally, the gain `K` of the integrator `int1` is set to `2.7777777777777777E-4` (for unit conversion).\n  \n  -- REGION Integrator Update\n     The enable signal for the integrator `int1` is determined by `E`, `RST`, and `PULSE_MODE`. If `RST` or `PULSE_MODE` is `TRUE`, the integrator does not operate. Otherwise, the integrator updates the integral value `X` based on the input velocity `VX`.\n\n  -- REGION Reset Handling\n     If `RST` is `TRUE`, `X` and `Y` are reset to `0`, and `tl`, `x_last`, and `y_last` are updated.\n\n  -- REGION Pulse Mode Handling\n     If both `E` and `PULSE_MODE` are `TRUE`, the value of `VX` is accumulated into `X` on the rising edge of `E` (i.e., when `E` changes from `FALSE` to `TRUE`).\n\n  -- REGION Counter Update\n     If the value of `X` exceeds `1.0`, the integer part of `X` is added to `Y`, and the fractional part of `X` is retained.\n\n  -- REGION Flow Calculation\n     The flow rate `F` is calculated based on the difference between the current time `tx` and the last update time `tl`. The flow rate formula is:\n    \\[\n    F = \\frac{(Y - y_{\\text{last}}) + (X - x_{\\text{last}})}{tx - tl} \\times 3.6 \\times 10^6\n    \\]\n     Here, `3.6E6` is the unit conversion factor. After calculation, `y_last`, `x_last`, and `tl` are updated.", "name": "FLOW_METER"}

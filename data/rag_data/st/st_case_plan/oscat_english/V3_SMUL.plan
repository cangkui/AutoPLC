{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function written in SCL, named 'V3_SMUL', designed to perform scalar multiplication on a 3D vector. The function takes a 3D vector and a real number as input and returns a new 3D vector where each component is the product of the corresponding input vector component and the real number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: A (a 3D vector), M (a real number)\n - Output variable: The function returns a 3D vector whose components are calculated as the product of the input vector and the real number.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Scalar Multiplication\n   This region implements the scalar multiplication operation for a 3D vector. The specific steps are as follows:\n   1. Calculate the X component of the output vector: Multiply the X component of input vector A by real number M and assign the result to the X component of the output vector.\n   2. Calculate the Y component of the output vector: Multiply the Y component of input vector A by real number M and assign the result to the Y component of the output vector.\n   3. Calculate the Z component of the output vector: Multiply the Z component of input vector A by real number M and assign the result to the Z component of the output vector.\n   Finally, the function returns a new 3D vector whose components are the products of the input vector and the real number.", "name": "V3_SMUL"}

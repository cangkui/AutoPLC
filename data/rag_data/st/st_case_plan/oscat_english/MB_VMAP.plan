  "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `MB_VMAP` is used to map virtual addresses to physical addresses while handling related error detection. It traverses an array `VMAP` containing virtual address mapping data, calculates the corresponding physical address and bit offset based on the input virtual address and function code (FC), and sets error flags.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `VMAP` is an array containing virtual address mapping data.\n - Input Variables: `FC` is the function code, `V_ADR` is the virtual address, `V_CNT` is the count of virtual addresses, and `SIZE` is the size of the physical address.\n - Output Variables: `P_ADR` is the physical address, `P_BIT` is the bit offset, and `ERROR` is the error code.\n - Internal Variables: `i` is a loop counter, `vopt` is the function code for virtual address mapping, `vadr` is the virtual address, `padr` is the physical address, `mask` is a bitmask, `vsize` is the virtual address size, `w_tmp` is a temporary word variable, `i_tmp` is a temporary integer variable, and `init` is an initialization flag.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Initialization\n    During the first run, the first element of the `VMAP` array is initialized. If `VMAP[1].FC` is 0, it is set to `DWORD#16#FFFF_FFFF`, and default virtual address and size values are applied.\n -- REGION Error Detection\n    First, the error code `ERROR` is set to `BYTE#02`. Then, a bitmask `mask` is generated based on the function code `FC`, and a check is performed to determine whether `V_CNT` should be set to 1. If `V_CNT` is 0, the function returns immediately.\n -- REGION Virtual Address Mapping\n    The `VMAP` array is traversed to check if each element's function code matches `mask`. If a match is found, the corresponding physical address and bit offset are calculated based on the function code type. If a valid mapping is successfully found, the error code `ERROR` is set to `BYTE#0`, and the loop exits. If no match is found, the error code `ERROR` is set to `BYTE#01`, and the function returns.\n -- REGION Timeout Handling\n    If the error code `ERROR` is `BYTE#0` and the function code `FC` matches certain specific masks, `VMAP[i].TIME_OUT` is set to `T#1ms`.",

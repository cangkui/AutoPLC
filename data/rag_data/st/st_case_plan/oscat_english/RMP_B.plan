{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `RMP_B`, which implements a Ramp Function. The block controls the output value to transition from 0 to 255 based on input signals, while providing status signals (such as `BUSY`, `HIGH`, `LOW`) to indicate the current output state.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input Variables**:\n    - `SET`: Used to directly set the output to the maximum value (255).\n    - `PT`: Specifies the ramp time (i.e., the time required to transition from 0 to 255).\n    - `E`: Enable signal, controlling whether the ramp function operates.\n    - `UP`: Direction signal, determining whether the ramp ascends (0 to 255) or descends (255 to 0).\n    - `RST`: Reset signal, used to directly set the output to 0.\n  - **Output Variables**:\n    - `OUT`: The output value of the ramp function, ranging from 0 to 255.\n    - `BUSY`: Indicates whether the ramp function is active (i.e., the output is neither 0 nor 255).\n    - `HIGH`: Indicates if the output has reached the maximum value (255).\n    - `LOW`: Indicates if the output is at the minimum value (0).\n  - **Internal Variables**:\n    - `rmp`: Used to call the core logic of the ramp function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Ramp Function Call\n    In this section, the internal ramp function `rmp` is called with the following parameters:\n    - `dir`: Direction signal, provided by the input `UP`.\n    - `E`: Enable signal, provided by the input `E`.\n    - `TR`: Time parameter, provided by the input `PT`.\n    - `rmp`: Output value, directly mapped to `OUT`.\n\n  -- REGION Reset and Set Logic\n    This section handles reset and set operations:\n    - If `RST` is true, the output `OUT` is directly set to 0.\n    - If `SET` is true, the output `OUT` is directly set to 255.\n\n  -- REGION Status Signal Updates\n    This section updates the status signals:\n    - `LOW`: Becomes true when the output `OUT` is 0.\n    - `HIGH`: Becomes true when the output `OUT` is 255.\n    - `BUSY`: Becomes true when the output `OUT` is neither 0 nor 255, and the enable signal `E` is true.\n\n- Summary\n  By calling the internal ramp function `rmp`, this function block achieves a smooth transition from 0 to 255 while providing reset, set, and status monitoring capabilities. Users can control the ramp direction, timing, and start/stop via input signals, while monitoring the current state through output signals.", "name": "RMP_B"}

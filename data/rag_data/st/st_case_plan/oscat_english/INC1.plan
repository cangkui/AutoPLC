{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple SCL function named 'INC1', designed to calculate and return an integer value based on the input values `X` and `N`. The function's logic is as follows: if `X` is greater than or equal to `N - 1`, it returns `0`; otherwise, it returns `X + 1`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `X` and `N`, both of integer type (INT), representing the current value and the maximum value, respectively.\n - Output variable: The function return value `INC1`, also of integer type (INT), representing the computed result.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n - If `X` is greater than or equal to `N - 1`, `INC1` is set to `0`. This means that when `X` reaches or exceeds `N - 1`, the function resets to `0`.\n - Otherwise, `INC1` is set to `X + 1`. This means that when `X` is less than `N - 1`, the function increments the value of `X`.\n\nThis function can be used to implement a loop counter, such as in scenarios requiring periodic increments where the counter resets upon reaching a certain maximum value.", "name": "INC1"}

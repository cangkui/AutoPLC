{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `DEL_CHARS`, is designed to remove all characters specified in the string `CX` from the input string `IN`. The function achieves this by iterating through the input string and checking whether each character exists in `CX`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` is the input string, and `CX` is an 80-character string containing the characters to be deleted.\n - Internal variables: `pos` represents the current character position being checked, initialized to 1; `stop` is the length of the input string, used to control the loop's termination condition.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   The function first assigns the input string `IN` to `DEL_CHARS` as the initial result. It then calculates the length of the input string and assigns it to `stop` to determine the loop's termination condition.\n\n-- REGION Character Deletion Logic\n   The function uses a `WHILE` loop to iterate through each character of the input string:\n   - In each iteration, the `MID` function extracts the current character (at position `pos`) from `DEL_CHARS`, and the `FIND` function checks whether this character exists in `CX`.\n   - If the character is found in `CX`, the `DELETE` function removes it from `DEL_CHARS`, and `stop` is decremented by 1 since the string length has decreased.\n   - If the character is not found in `CX`, `pos` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character.\n   The loop continues until `pos` exceeds `stop`, meaning the entire string has been traversed.\n\n-- REGION Output Result\n   After the loop completes, `DEL_CHARS` contains the resulting string with all specified characters removed, and the function returns this value.\n\n- Summary\nThis function removes specified characters from the input string by iterating through it and checking each character against the deletion list `CX`. The final result is the modified string with the specified characters removed.", "name": "DEL_CHARS"}

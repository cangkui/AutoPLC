Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block is named 'LTCH' and implements a simple latch logic. A latch is a fundamental digital circuit component used to store a single bit of state. The block controls the output signal state through input signals.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `D` (data input), `L` (latch signal), `RST` (reset signal)\n  - Output variable: `Q` (latch output state)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     This region contains the core logic of the latch. First, it checks whether the reset signal `RST` is true. If `RST` is true, the output `Q` is set to false, indicating the latch is reset. If `RST` is false, it checks whether the latch signal `L` is true. If `L` is true, the output `Q` is set to the value of input `D`, meaning the latch captures and stores the current data input. If `L` is false, the output `Q` retains its previous state.\n\n  This logic implements a simple latch where the output is forcibly reset when `RST` is true; updated to the input `D` value when `L` is true; and remains unchanged otherwise.", "name": "LTCH"}

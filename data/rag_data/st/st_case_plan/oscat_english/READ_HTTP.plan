{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'READ_HTTP', designed to read HTTP data from a buffer. It locates the HTTP data by searching for a specific string and extracts it into an output string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: SIZE (buffer size), POS (starting position for search), SRC (search string)\n - Input/Output variables: PT (buffer, of type NW_BUF_LONG)\n - Output variables: READ_HTTP (extracted HTTP data, of type STRING, with length defined by OSCAT_BASIC.STRING_LENGTH)\n - Local variables: index (for iterating through the buffer), s1 (start position of the found string), e1 (end position of the found string), stop (end position of the buffer)\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, calculate the end position `stop` of the buffer, setting it to `SIZE - 1`. Then, check if the input string `SRC` is empty. If it is, initialize it to `'HTTP/'`; otherwise, append `': '` to `SRC`.\n\n-- REGION String Search\n   Use the `OSCAT_BASIC.BUFFER_SEARCH` function to search for the string `SRC` in the buffer `PT`. The search starts from position `POS` and is case-insensitive. If a matching string is found, its start position `s1` is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned.\n\n-- REGION HTTP Data Extraction\n   If the search is successful (i.e., `s1 >= 0`), perform the following operations:\n   - Initialize `e1` to `s1`, representing the end position of the string.\n   - Traverse the buffer forward to find the start position `s1` of the string until encountering a character less than `BYTE#32` (space).\n   - Traverse the buffer backward to find the end position `e1` of the string until encountering a character less than `BYTE#32`.\n   - Adjust `s1` to skip the length of the search string.\n   - Use the `OSCAT_BASIC.BUFFER_TO_STRING` function to extract data from the buffer between `s1` and `e1` into the output string `READ_HTTP`.\n\n   If the search fails (i.e., `s1 < 0`), set `READ_HTTP` to an empty string.\n\n-- REGION End\n   The function block execution completes, returning the extracted HTTP data or an empty string.", "name": "READ_HTTP"}

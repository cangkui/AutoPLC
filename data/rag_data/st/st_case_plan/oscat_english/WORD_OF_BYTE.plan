{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple SCL function named `WORD_OF_BYTE`, designed to combine two bytes (`B1` and `B0`) into a 16-bit word (`WORD`). The function's logic involves left-shifting the high byte (`B1`) by 8 bits and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the low byte (`B0`) to produce the final 16-bit word.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `B1` and `B0`, both of type `BYTE`, representing the high byte and low byte, respectively.\n - Output variable: The function return value `WORD_OF_BYTE`, of type `WORD`, representing the combined 16-bit word.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe function's logic is straightforward and consists of the following steps:\n 1. Convert the high byte `B1` to type `WORD`, then left-shift it by 8 bits using the `SHL` function. This step places the value of `B1` in the high 8 bits of the 16-bit word.\n 2. Convert the low byte `B0` to type `WORD`.\n 3. Use a bitwise OR operation (`OR`) to combine the left-shifted high byte and the low byte, resulting in the final 16-bit word.\n 4. Assign the combined word to the function return value `WORD_OF_BYTE`.\n\nThe core idea of this function is to merge two bytes into a larger data type using bitwise operations, making it suitable for scenarios where byte data needs to be combined into a larger data type.", "name": "WORD_OF_BYTE"}

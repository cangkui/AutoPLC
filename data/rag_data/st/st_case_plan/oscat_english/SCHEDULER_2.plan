{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block, named `SCHEDULER_2`, is used to schedule output signals based on input enable signals and counter values. It tracks time using an internal counter `sx` and determines the state of the output signals by comparing the counter's value with input parameters.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `E0`, `E1`, `E2`, `E3` are enable signals; `C0`, `C1`, `C2`, `C3` are counter periods; `O0`, `O1`, `O2`, `O3` are offset values.\n - Output variables: `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` are the scheduled output signals.\n - Internal variable: `sx` is an internal counter used to track time.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Scheduling Logic\n   This region implements the scheduling logic. First, the state of each output signal (`Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`) is determined based on the relationship between the internal counter `sx` and the input parameters. Specifically, each output signal is calculated using the following formulas:\n   - `Q0 := E0 AND (sx MOD C0 - O0 = 0);`\n   - `Q1 := E1 AND (sx MOD C1 - O1 = 0);`\n   - `Q2 := E2 AND (sx MOD C2 - O2 = 0);`\n   - `Q3 := E3 AND (sx MOD C3 - O3 = 0);`\n   These formulas mean that if the enable signal is true and the result of subtracting the offset from the modulo of the internal counter `sx` with the period is zero, the output signal is set to true. Otherwise, it remains false.\n\n-- REGION Counter Update\n   This region updates the value of the internal counter `sx`. Each time the functional block is executed, the counter `sx` increments by one:\n   - `sx := sx + 1;`\n   This counter is used to track time, enabling the scheduling logic to compute the state of the output signals.\n\n- Output Results\n   - `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` are the output signals calculated by the scheduling logic. Their states depend on the enable signals, counter periods, offset values, and the internal counter `sx`.", "name": "SCHEDULER_2"}

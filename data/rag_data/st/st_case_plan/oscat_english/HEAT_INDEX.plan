Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function is named `HEAT_INDEX` and is used to calculate the Heat Index. The Heat Index is a composite measure that combines temperature and humidity to describe how hot it feels to the human body. The function takes temperature `T` and relative humidity `RH` as inputs and outputs the calculated Heat Index.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `T` (temperature in degrees Celsius) and `RH` (relative humidity as a percentage).\n  - Local variables: `RH2` (square of relative humidity) and `T2` (square of temperature).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Heat Index Calculation\n     - First, check the input conditions. If the relative humidity `RH` is less than 20% or the temperature `T` is less than 20Â°C, directly return the temperature `T` as the Heat Index. This is because the Heat Index calculation is not applicable or has minimal impact under low humidity or low-temperature conditions.\n     - If the conditions are met (i.e., `RH >= 20.0` and `T >= 20.0`), proceed with the Heat Index calculation:\n       1. Calculate the square of relative humidity `RH2` and the square of temperature `T2`.\n       2. Convert the temperature `T` from Celsius to Fahrenheit (by calling the `OSCAT_BASIC.C_TO_F` function).\n       3. Use the following formula to calculate the Heat Index:\n          ```\n          HEAT_INDEX = -42.379 + 2.04901523 * T - 6.83783E-3 * T2\n                      + RH * (10.1433127 - 0.22475541 * T + 1.22874E-3 * T2)\n                      + RH2 * (8.5282E-4 * T - 5.481717E-2 - 1.99E-6 * T2)\n          ```\n       4. Convert the calculated Heat Index from Fahrenheit back to Celsius (by calling the `OSCAT_BASIC.F_TO_C` function).\n     - Finally, return the calculated Heat Index `HEAT_INDEX`.\n\n- Notes\n  - This function relies on the `C_TO_F` and `F_TO_C` functions from the `OSCAT_BASIC` library for Celsius-Fahrenheit conversions.\n  - Under low humidity or low-temperature conditions, the Heat Index calculation is simplified, directly returning the temperature value.\n  - The coefficients in the formula are based on empirical data to simulate how the human body perceives temperature under different temperature and humidity conditions.", "name": "HEAT_INDEX"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `R2_ADD` designed to perform addition operations on inputs of custom type `Real2` and `REAL` type. `Real2` is a derived type containing two real number members, `R1` and `RX`. The function's return value is also of type `Real2`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` is a `Real2` type variable with two real number members, `R1` and `RX`; `Y` is a `REAL` type variable.\n  - Internal variables: `temp` is a `REAL` type temporary variable used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    1. First, assign the value of `X.RX` to the temporary variable `temp` for subsequent calculations.\n    2. Calculate the value of `R2_ADD.RX` using the formula: `Y + X.R1 + X.RX`. This is the result of adding `Y`, `X.R1`, and `X.RX`.\n    3. Calculate the value of `R2_ADD.R1` using the formula: `temp - R2_ADD.RX + Y + X.R1`. Here, the previously stored `temp` value is used, subtracting `R2_ADD.RX`, then adding `Y` and `X.R1`.\n    4. Finally, the function returns a `Real2` type value, with its members `RX` and `R1` derived from the above calculations.", "name": "R2_ADD"}

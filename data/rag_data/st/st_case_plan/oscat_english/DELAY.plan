{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `DELAY`, designed to implement a simple delay effect. It uses a buffer array to store input values and returns the delayed value as output. The block supports a reset operation and allows dynamic adjustment of the delay steps.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input value), `N` (number of delay steps), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variable: `OUT` (delayed output value).\n  - Internal variables: `buf` (buffer array for storing input values), `i` (current buffer index), `init` (initialization flag), `stop` (limit for maximum delay steps).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset\n     - First, the value of `stop` is calculated, representing the maximum valid index of the buffer. The value of `stop` is constrained between 0 and 31 using the `LIMIT` function and adjusted based on the value of `N`.\n     - If the reset signal `RST` is true, or if the block has not been initialized (`init` is false), the initialization process is executed:\n       - The `init` flag is set to true.\n       - A `FOR` loop initializes all elements of the buffer array `buf` to the current input value `IN`.\n       - The output value `OUT` is set to the current input value `IN`.\n       - The index `i` is reset to 0.\n\n  -- REGION Delay Logic\n     - If the value of `stop` is less than 0, indicating no delay steps, the output value `OUT` is directly set to the current input value `IN`.\n     - Otherwise, the delay logic is executed:\n       - The output value `OUT` is set to the value in the buffer array `buf` at the current index `i`.\n       - The current input value `IN` is stored in the buffer array `buf` at the current index `i`.\n       - The `INC1` function increments the index `i`, ensuring it cycles between 0 and `N-1`.\n\n- Output Result\n  The output value `OUT` of the block is the value after delay processing. The specific number of delay steps is determined by the input variable `N`, while the reset signal `RST` can clear the buffer and reinitialize the block.", "name": "DELAY"}

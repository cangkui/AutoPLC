{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `MS_TO_BFT` is used to convert wind speed from meters per second (m/s) to the Beaufort Scale (abbreviated as BFT). The Beaufort Scale is a system for classifying wind speeds, widely used in meteorology and maritime fields.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `MS`, representing wind speed in meters per second (m/s), of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n  - Output variable: `MS_TO_BFT`, representing the converted Beaufort Scale value, of type `INT` (integer).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Conversion Logic\n      This region implements the conversion from wind speed in m/s to the Beaufort Scale. The conversion formula is:\n      \\[\n      \\text{MS\\_TO\\_BFT} = \\text{REAL\\_TO\\_INT}(\\text{EXPT}(\\text{MS} \\times 1.196172, 0.666667))\n      \\]\n      The specific steps are as follows:\n      1. Multiply the input wind speed `MS` by the constant `1.196172`.\n      2. Apply an exponential operation to the result with an exponent of `0.666667` (i.e., \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)).\n      3. Convert the final result to an integer using the `REAL_TO_INT` function, which serves as the output Beaufort Scale value.\n\n  This formula is based on the empirical relationship between the Beaufort Scale and wind speed, enabling the conversion of wind speed in m/s to the corresponding Beaufort Scale value.", "name": "MS_TO_BFT"}

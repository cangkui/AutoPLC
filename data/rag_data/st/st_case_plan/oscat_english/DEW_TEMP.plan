{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named 'DEW_TEMP' that calculates the dew point temperature. The dew point temperature is the temperature at which water vapor in the air begins to condense into dew, given the relative humidity and temperature. The function uses mathematical formulas based on the inputs of relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: Relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T).\n - Constants: a and b, which are used as fixed values in the calculation formula.\n - Internal variable: V, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Dew Point Temperature Calculation\n    This region contains the core logic of the function for calculating the dew point temperature.\n    1. First, it checks whether the relative humidity (RH) is greater than 0. If RH > 0, the calculation proceeds; otherwise, the dew point temperature is set to the physical constant T0 (absolute zero).\n    2. If RH > 0, the intermediate variable V is calculated as:\n       - V = LOG(RH * 0.01 * OSCAT_BASIC.EXP10((a*T) / (b+T)))\n       Here, LOG is the natural logarithm function, and OSCAT_BASIC.EXP10 is the base-10 exponential function.\n    3. The dew point temperature is then calculated using V:\n       - DEW_TEMP = b*V / (a-V)\n       This formula is a variation of the Magnus-Tetens equation, used to compute the dew point temperature.\n    4. If RH is not greater than 0, the dew point temperature is directly set to OSCAT_BASIC.phys.T0 (a physical constant, typically representing absolute zero).\n -- REGION Output Result\n    This region returns the calculated result to the caller. The function's return value is the computed dew point temperature (DEW_TEMP).", "name": "DEW_TEMP"}

  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function, named `CMP`, is designed to compare two real numbers `X` and `Y` to determine whether their difference is smaller than a dynamically calculated threshold. This threshold is computed based on the absolute value of `X` and an input parameter `N`. The function outputs a boolean value indicating whether the difference between `X` and `Y` falls within the allowed range.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y` are the two real numbers to be compared, and `N` is an integer used to calculate the dynamic threshold.\n  - Internal variable: `tmp` is a temporary variable used to store intermediate results during computation.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculate Dynamic Threshold\n    1. First, compute the absolute value of `X` and store it in `tmp`.\n    2. If `tmp` is greater than 0.0, calculate the dynamic threshold as follows:\n       - Use the `LOG` function to compute the logarithm of `tmp`.\n       - Use the `FLOOR` function to round the logarithmic value down to the nearest integer.\n       - Subtract `N` from the result, add 1, and convert it to a real number.\n       - Use the `EXP10` function to compute 10 raised to this power, yielding the dynamic threshold.\n    3. If `tmp` is not greater than 0.0, directly use `tmp` as the dynamic threshold (this may introduce logical issues since `tmp` is already the absolute value of `X`. If `tmp` is 0, `EXP10(tmp)` would return 1, which might not be the intended behavior).\n  \n  -- REGION: Compare the Difference\n    1. Compute the absolute difference between `X` and `Y`.\n    2. Check whether this difference is smaller than the dynamic threshold `tmp`.\n    3. Assign the comparison result to the output variable `CMP`.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns a boolean value `CMP`, indicating whether the difference between `X` and `Y` is within the dynamically calculated threshold range. If the difference is smaller than the threshold, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Notes\n  1. If the absolute value of `X` is 0, `LOG(tmp)` would cause an error (since `LOG(0)` is undefined). However, the code avoids this scenario by checking `IF tmp > 0.0`.\n  2. When `tmp` is not greater than 0.0, the code directly uses `EXP10(tmp)` as the threshold, which may not be the intended behavior. For instance, if `tmp` is 0, `EXP10(0)` returns 1, which might not align with practical requirements. Adjustments to the logic may be necessary based on specific use cases.",

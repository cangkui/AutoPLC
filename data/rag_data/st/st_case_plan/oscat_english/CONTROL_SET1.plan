{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a functional block named `CONTROL_SET1`, which calculates controller parameters based on the input control mode (P, PI, or PID). It supports proportional (P), proportional-integral (PI), and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control modes, and outputs the corresponding control parameters based on the input conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Include controller gain (`Kt`), time constant (`Tt`), control mode selection (`PI` and `PID`), as well as gains and time constants for different control modes (`P_K`, `PI_K`, `PI_TN`, `PID_K`, `PID_TN`, `PID_TV`).\n  - Output variables: Include proportional gain (`KP`), integral time constant (`TN`), derivative time constant (`TV`), integral gain (`KI`), and derivative gain (`KD`).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Control Mode Selection and Parameter Calculation\n     This region selects the appropriate control algorithm based on the input control mode (`PI` and `PID`) and calculates the control parameters.\n     - If both `PI` and `PID` modes are selected, `KP`, `TN`, and `TV` are set to 0, indicating an invalid state.\n     - If only `PID` mode is selected, `KP`, `TN`, and `TV` are calculated based on `PID_K`, `PID_TN`, and `PID_TV`.\n     - If only `PI` mode is selected, `KP` and `TN` are calculated based on `PI_K` and `PI_TN`.\n     - If no mode is selected (default case), `KP` is calculated based on `P_K`.\n  -- REGION Integral and Derivative Gain Calculation\n     This region calculates the integral gain (`KI`) and derivative gain (`KD`) based on the computed `KP`, `TN`, and `TV`.\n     - If `TN` is greater than 0, `KI` is calculated as `KP / TN`; otherwise, `KI` is set to 0.\n     - `KD` is calculated as `KP * TV`.\n\n- Output Results\n  Finally, the functional block outputs the calculated controller parameters (`KP`, `TN`, `TV`, `KI`, and `KD`) based on the selected control mode and input parameters, for use by external control systems.", "name": "CONTROL_SET1"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SECOND_OF_DT`, which extracts the seconds component from data of type `DT` (datetime). The `DT` type typically contains both date and time information, and this function specifically retrieves the seconds portion.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one category of variables:\n  - Input variable: `XDT`, of type `DT`, representing the input datetime value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Extract Seconds\n     The core logic of the function is to extract the seconds from `XDT`. First, the `DT` type data is converted to `DWORD` type (double word, a 32-bit unsigned integer), then a modulo 60 operation (`MOD 60`) is performed to isolate the seconds component. Finally, the result is converted from `DWORD` type to `INT` type (integer) and returned as the function's output.\n\n     The detailed logic is as follows:\n     1. `DT_TO_DWORD(XDT)`: Converts the `DT` type `XDT` to `DWORD` type.\n     2. `MOD 60`: Applies modulo 60 to the converted `DWORD` value to extract the seconds.\n     3. `DWORD_TO_INT(...)`: Converts the extracted seconds from `DWORD` type to `INT` type.\n     4. `SECOND_OF_DT := ...`: Assigns the result to the function's return value.\n\n     The function's logic is very straightforward, designed solely to extract seconds from datetime data, making it useful for scenarios where seconds need to be processed separately.", "name": "SECOND_OF_DT"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code snippet is a simple function block named 'TC_S', designed to calculate the time interval since the last call and output the result in seconds. The function block utilizes system time functions to fetch the current time and computes the time difference to output the interval.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Output Variable: TC, representing the calculated time interval (in seconds).\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - init: A boolean flag indicating whether the function block has been initialized.\n    - tx: A DWORD type variable storing the current timestamp.\n    - last: A DWORD type variable storing the timestamp from the previous call.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization and Time Calculation\n     The logic of the function block is divided into two parts: initialization and time calculation.\n     1. **Initialization**:\n        - The system function `T_PLC_US()` is used to obtain the current timestamp, which is stored in the variable `tx`.\n        - If `init` is `FALSE`, it indicates the function block hasn't been initialized yet. In this case, `init` is set to `TRUE`, and the output variable `TC` is initialized to `0.0`.\n     2. **Time Calculation**:\n        - If `init` is `TRUE`, meaning the function block is already initialized, the difference between the current timestamp `tx` and the previous timestamp `last` is calculated. This difference is then converted to seconds (by multiplying by `1.0E-6`) and stored in the output variable `TC`.\n        - Finally, the current timestamp `tx` is stored in `last` for use in the next call.\n\n  -- REGION Output\n     The output of the function block is the variable `TC`, which represents the time interval (in seconds) since the last call. This value is updated with each call.\n\n- Summary\n  The primary purpose of this function block is to calculate the time interval between two consecutive calls using system time functions and output it in seconds. It ensures proper initialization during the first call via the `init` flag and computes the time difference by storing the previous timestamp in `last`. Such function blocks are commonly used in scenarios requiring time interval monitoring, such as measuring the execution time of periodic tasks.", "name": "TC_S"}

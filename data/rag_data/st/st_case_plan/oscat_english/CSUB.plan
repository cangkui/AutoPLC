{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block `CSUB` is used to calculate the difference between two complex numbers `X` and `Y`, and return the result. The difference of complex numbers is computed by subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of complex type, representing the minuend and subtrahend respectively.\n  - Output variable: `CSUB`, a complex type representing the difference between `X` and `Y`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Unnamed Region:\n      In this region, first the difference between the real parts of `X` and `Y` is calculated, and the result is assigned to `CSUB.re`. Then the difference between the imaginary parts of `X` and `Y` is calculated, and the result is assigned to `CSUB.im`. Thus, `CSUB` contains the difference between `X` and `Y`.", "name": "CSUB"}

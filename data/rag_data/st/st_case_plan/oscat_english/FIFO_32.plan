{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue function block named 'FIFO_32'. It is designed to store and retrieve 32 DWORD-type data elements. The key feature of a FIFO queue is that the first data entered is the first to be retrieved. The function block supports reset, read, write, and enable operations, and can detect whether the queue is empty or full.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `Din` (input data), `E` (enable signal), `RD` (read signal), `WD` (write signal), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `Dout` (output data), `EMPTY` (queue empty flag), `FULL` (queue full flag).\n  - Internal variables: `fifo` (array storing queue data), `pr` (read pointer), `pw` (write pointer).\n  - Constant: `n` (queue capacity, default is 32).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Reset Logic\n    If the reset signal `RST` is true, the reset operation is executed. This includes:\n    - Setting the write pointer `pw` to the read pointer `pr`, effectively clearing the queue.\n    - Setting the `FULL` flag to false, indicating the queue is not full.\n    - Setting the `EMPTY` flag to true, indicating the queue is empty.\n    - Setting the output data `Dout` to 0.\n\n  -- REGION Enable Logic\n    If the enable signal `E` is true, the following operations are performed:\n    - If the queue is not empty (`EMPTY` is false) and the read signal `RD` is true, data is read from the queue:\n      - The data at the read pointer `pr` position in the `fifo` array is assigned to `Dout`.\n      - The `INC1` function increments the read pointer `pr`, ensuring it stays within the queue capacity.\n      - If the read pointer `pr` equals the write pointer `pw`, the `EMPTY` flag is set to true, indicating the queue is now empty.\n      - The `FULL` flag is set to false since at least one data element has been read.\n    - If the queue is not full (`FULL` is false) and the write signal `WD` is true, data is written to the queue:\n      - The input data `Din` is written to the position of the write pointer `pw` in the `fifo` array.\n      - The `INC1` function increments the write pointer `pw`, ensuring it stays within the queue capacity.\n      - If the write pointer `pw` equals the read pointer `pr`, the `FULL` flag is set to true, indicating the queue is now full.\n      - The `EMPTY` flag is set to false since at least one data element has been written.\n\n  -- REGION End Logic\n    After the function block logic is executed, the program concludes.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements a simple FIFO queue, supporting data write and read operations while providing queue status (empty/full) detection. The reset signal clears the queue, and the enable signal controls whether operations take effect. The management of read and write pointers ensures the First-In-First-Out characteristic of the data.", "name": "FIFO_32"}

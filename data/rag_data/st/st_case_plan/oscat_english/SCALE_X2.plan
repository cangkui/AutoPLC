Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SCALE_X2`, which scales two values based on input conditions and adds the result to an offset. The core logic of the function involves using the `SEL` function to select the minimum or maximum of the input values, followed by scaling and offset calculations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `IN1` and `IN2`: Boolean values used to select the minimum or maximum.\n    - `K`: Scaling coefficient, of type `REAL`.\n    - `O`: Offset value, of type `REAL`.\n    - `IN1_MIN` and `IN1_MAX`: The minimum and maximum values corresponding to `IN1`, of type `REAL`, with `IN1_MAX` defaulting to `1000.0`.\n    - `IN2_MIN` and `IN2_MAX`: The minimum and maximum values corresponding to `IN2`, of type `REAL`, with `IN2_MAX` defaulting to `1000.0`.\n  - Output Variable:\n    - `SCALE_X2`: The return value of the function, of type `REAL`, representing the computed result.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function uses the `SEL` function to select the corresponding minimum or maximum based on the values of `IN1` and `IN2`. The `SEL` function operates as follows:\n    - If `IN1` is `TRUE`, it selects `IN1_MAX`; otherwise, it selects `IN1_MIN`.\n    - If `IN2` is `TRUE`, it selects `IN2_MAX`; otherwise, it selects `IN2_MIN`.\n    The two selected results are then added together, multiplied by the scaling coefficient `K`, and added to the offset `O`, ultimately yielding the value of `SCALE_X2`. The formula is as follows:\n    ```\n    SCALE_X2 = (SEL(IN1, IN1_MIN, IN1_MAX) + SEL(IN2, IN2_MIN, IN2_MAX)) * K + O\n    ```\n    This function can be used to dynamically scale and offset two input values, making it suitable for scenarios where conditional adjustments to computation results are required.", "name": "SCALE_X2"}

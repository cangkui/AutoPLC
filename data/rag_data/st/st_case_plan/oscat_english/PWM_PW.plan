{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block, named `PWM_PW`, is used to generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal. Based on the input frequency (`F`) and pulse width (`PW`), it produces a Boolean output signal (`Q`) that toggles between high and low levels.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Frequency (`F`) and pulse width (`PW`).\n  - Output variable: Boolean signal (`Q`).\n  - Internal variables: Clock (`clk`) and pulse generator (`pulse`).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     This section contains the core logic of the functional block. First, it checks whether the input frequency (`F`) is greater than 0. If true, it calculates the clock period (`PT`) from the frequency and uses the `CLK_PRG` functional block to generate a clock signal (`clk.Q`). Then, it uses the `TP_X` functional block to generate a pulse signal (`pulse.Q`), whose width is determined by the input pulse width (`PW`). Finally, it assigns the pulse signal (`pulse.Q`) to the output signal (`Q`).\n\n     The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Calculate the clock period: `PT := REAL_TO_TIME(1000.0 / F)`, converting the frequency into a time period.\n     2. Generate the clock signal: `CLK(PT := PT)`, using the `CLK_PRG` functional block to produce a periodic clock signal.\n     3. Generate the pulse signal: `Pulse(in := clk.Q, pt := pw)`, using the `TP_X` functional block to create a pulse signal with a width determined by `PW`.\n     4. Output signal: `Q := pulse.Q`, assigning the pulse signal to the output.\n\n     If the input frequency (`F`) is not greater than 0, no action is taken, and the output signal (`Q`) retains its default value (typically `FALSE`).", "name": "PWM_PW"}

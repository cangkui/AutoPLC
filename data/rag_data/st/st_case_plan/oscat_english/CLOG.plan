{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `CLOG` is used to compute the natural logarithm of a complex number (complex logarithm). The natural logarithm of a complex number is itself a complex number, where the real part is the natural logarithm of the modulus of the complex number, and the imaginary part is the argument (phase angle) of the complex number. This function takes a complex number as input and returns its complex logarithm.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Output variables: `CLOG.re` and `CLOG.im`, representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex logarithm, respectively.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute Complex Logarithm\n    The core logic of this function involves calculating the natural logarithm of a complex number, divided into two steps:\n    1. Compute the real part of the complex logarithm: `CLOG.re := LN(HYPOT(X.re, X.im))`\n       - Use `HYPOT(X.re, X.im)` to compute the modulus of the complex number (i.e., the absolute value of the complex number, given by the formula `sqrt(X.re^2 + X.im^2)`).\n       - Use the `LN` function to compute the natural logarithm of the modulus, yielding the real part of the complex logarithm.\n    2. Compute the imaginary part of the complex logarithm: `CLOG.im := ATAN2(X.im, X.re)`\n       - Use `ATAN2(X.im, X.re)` to compute the argument of the complex number (i.e., the phase angle of the complex number, given by the formula `atan2(X.im, X.re)`), yielding the imaginary part of the complex logarithm.\n\n    Ultimately, the function returns the complex logarithm as a complex number, with its real and imaginary parts being the results of the above computations.", "name": "CLOG"}

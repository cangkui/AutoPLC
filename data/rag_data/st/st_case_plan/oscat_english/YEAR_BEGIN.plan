{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `YEAR_BEGIN` that calculates the date of the first day of a given year. It takes an integer representing the year as input and returns the date of the first day of that year.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `y`, representing the year.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating the First Day of the Year\n     The function's logic is implemented through the following steps:\n     1. Convert the input year `y` to the DWORD type.\n     2. Multiply the year by 1461 (a constant related to leap year calculations) and then subtract 2878169 (another constant). This operation adjusts the year to a certain reference point.\n     3. Use the `SHR` (right shift) operation to divide the result by 4 (since shifting right by 2 bits is equivalent to dividing by 4), which helps convert the year into the number of days from the reference point.\n     4. Multiply the number of days by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day) to convert the days into seconds.\n     5. Use the `DWORD_TO_DATE` function to convert the seconds into a date type, ultimately obtaining the date of the first day of the year.\n     Finally, the function returns the calculated date.", "name": "YEAR_BEGIN"}

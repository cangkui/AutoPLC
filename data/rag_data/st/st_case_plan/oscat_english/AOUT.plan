{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `AOUT`, and its purpose is to convert an input real number `in` into a DWORD-type output value. The conversion process takes into account the input value's range (limited by the `low` and `high` parameters), bit width (specified by the `Bits` parameter), and sign bit (specified by the `sign` parameter). The main goal of this function is to map a floating-point number to a fixed-bit-width integer range, optionally including a sign bit.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in` (input floating-point number), `Bits` (bit width of the output value), `sign` (position of the sign bit, default value is 255, indicating unsigned), `low` (minimum range of the input value), `high` (maximum range of the input value, default is 10.0).\n - Constants: `ff` (a DWORD-type constant with a value of 1).\n - Internal variables: `in2` (stores the processed input value), `sx` (stores the Boolean value of the sign bit).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Input Processing\n   First, the function checks if the `sign` parameter is less than 32. If true, it calls the `sign_R` function to obtain the sign of the input value `in` and stores it in `sx`. It then uses the `ABS` function to get the absolute value of `in` and stores it in `in2`. If the `sign` parameter is 32 or greater, it directly assigns the value of `in` to `in2`, indicating no sign bit processing is needed.\n   \n-- REGION Range Limiting\n   Next, the `LIMIT` function is used to constrain the value of `in2` between `low` and `high`. If `in2` is less than `low`, it is set to `low`; if `in2` is greater than `high`, it is set to `high`.\n\n-- REGION Mapping to Integer Range\n   The function then maps `in2` to a DWORD-type integer range. The steps are as follows:\n   1. Calculate the relative value of `in2` to `low`: `(in2 - low)`.\n   2. Calculate the range between `high` and `low`: `(high - low)`.\n   3. Divide the relative value by the range to get a proportional value: `(in2 - low) / (high - low)`.\n   4. Use the `SHL` function to left-shift the constant `ff` by `Bits` bits and subtract 1 to get a mask value: `SHL(ff, Bits) - 1`.\n   5. Multiply the proportional value by the mask value and convert it to DWORD type: `REAL_TO_DWORD(...)`.\n   The final result is stored in `Aout`.\n\n-- REGION Sign Bit Processing\n   If `sx` is true (indicating a sign bit is needed), the `SHL` function is used to left-shift the constant `ff` by `sign` bits, and the result is bitwise ORed with `Aout`. The final result is stored in `Aout`.\n\n-- REGION Output\n   The function ultimately returns `Aout`, the DWORD value after mapping and sign bit processing.", "name": "AOUT"}

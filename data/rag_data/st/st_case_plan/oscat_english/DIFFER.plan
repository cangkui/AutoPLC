{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function named `DIFFER` that compares whether the absolute difference between two real-number inputs `in1` and `in2` is greater than a given threshold `X`. If the difference exceeds `X`, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `in1`: The first real-number input.\n    - `in2`: The second real-number input.\n    - `X`: The threshold used to compare the difference between `in1` and `in2`.\n  - Output variable:\n    - `DIFFER`: A boolean value indicating whether the absolute difference between `in1` and `in2` is greater than `X`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of the function involves calculating the absolute difference between `in1` and `in2` and comparing it with the threshold `X`. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Calculate the difference between `in1` and `in2`: `in1 - in2`.\n     2. Take the absolute value of the difference: `ABS(in1 - in2)`.\n     3. Compare the absolute value with the threshold `X`: `ABS(in1 - in2) > X`.\n     4. If the comparison result is true, `DIFFER` is assigned `TRUE`; otherwise, it is assigned `FALSE`.\n\n  This function can be used to detect whether two values are significantly different, such as monitoring whether sensor readings exceed an allowable range in a monitoring system.", "name": "DIFFER"}

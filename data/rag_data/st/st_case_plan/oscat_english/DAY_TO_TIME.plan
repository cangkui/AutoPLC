{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `DAY_TO_TIME`, which converts an input number of days (of type `REAL`) into a time value (of type `TIME`). The conversion logic is based on the calculation that one day equals 86,400,000 milliseconds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variable:\n    - `IN`: A `REAL` type variable representing the input number of days.\n  - No other variables are defined, as this is a straightforward conversion function.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Conversion Logic:\n    The core logic of the function involves converting the input number of days into milliseconds and then into a `TIME` type. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Multiply the input days (`IN`) by 86,400,000 (since one day equals 86,400,000 milliseconds) to obtain a value in milliseconds.\n    2. Use the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function to convert the `REAL` type milliseconds into a `DWORD` type.\n    3. Use the `DWORD_TO_TIME` function to convert the `DWORD` type milliseconds into a `TIME` type.\n    4. Assign the final result to the function's return value `DAY_TO_TIME`.\n\n  Examples:\n  - If the input is `IN = 1.0`, representing 1 day, the calculation results in `86,400,000` milliseconds, and the function returns `T#1D`.\n  - If the input is `IN = 0.5`, representing 0.5 days, the calculation results in `43,200,000` milliseconds, and the function returns `T#12H`.\n\n  Notes:\n  - Due to the limited range of the `TIME` type (`T#0` to `T#24D20H31M23S647MS`), excessively large input values may cause overflow.\n  - The input number of days should be non-negative; otherwise, the result may not meet expectations.", "name": "DAY_TO_TIME"}

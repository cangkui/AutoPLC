{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named 'INV' to calculate the reciprocal of an input real number `X`. If the input value is 0, no operation is performed, and the function returns the default value (which is 0.0 by default in SCL).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function is very simple: first, it checks whether the input value `X` is not equal to 0.0. If the condition is true, it calculates `1.0 / X` and assigns the result to the function output `INV`. If `X` equals 0.0, the calculation is skipped, and the function output retains its default value (0.0).\n     This design avoids division-by-zero errors, ensuring the robustness of the function.", "name": "INV"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `FILE_PATH_SPLIT`, which splits a file path into three parts: the drive, directory, and filename. The function takes a filename as input and stores the split results in a `FILE_PATH_DATA` structure.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `FILENAME`, representing the file path to be split.\n - Input-output variable: `X`, of type `FILE_PATH_DATA`, used to store the split drive, directory, and filename.\n - Internal variables:\n   - `b`: A counter for loops.\n   - `c`: Stores the length of the file path.\n   - `d`: Stores a single character from the file path.\n   - `p1`: Stores the end position of the drive path (i.e., the colon's position).\n   - `p2`: Stores the end position of the directory path (i.e., the last slash's position).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, initialize the `DRIVE`, `DIRECTORY`, and `FILENAME` fields in the `X` structure as empty strings. Then, get the length `c` of the file path. If the file path length is 0, the input is invalid, so the function returns `FALSE` and terminates.\n\n-- REGION Finding Drive and Directory Separators\n   Use a `FOR` loop to iterate through each character of the file path, searching for the end position of the drive path (colon `:`) and the end position of the directory path (slash `/` or backslash `\\`). If a colon is found, store its position in `p1`; if a slash or backslash is found, store its position in `p2`.\n\n-- REGION Extracting the Drive Path\n   If the value of `p1` is 2 (indicating a valid drive path), use the `LEFT` function to extract the drive path and store it in `X.DRIVE`.\n\n-- REGION Extracting the Directory Path\n   If `p2` is greater than 0 and greater than `p1`, indicating a valid directory path, use the `MID` function to extract the directory path and store it in `X.DIRECTORY`.\n\n-- REGION Extracting the Filename\n   Use the `RIGHT` function to extract the filename portion and store it in `X.FILENAME`. The starting position of the filename is the end position of the drive path or directory path (whichever is larger between `p1` and `p2`) plus 1.\n\n-- REGION Returning the Result\n   The function returns `TRUE` upon successful execution, indicating the file path has been split.", "name": "FILE_PATH_SPLIT"}

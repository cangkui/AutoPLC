Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function called `IS_ALPHA`, which checks whether the input string contains only alphabetic characters (A-Z or a-z). If all characters in the string are letters, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`. An empty string is considered invalid and returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `str`, representing the string to be checked.\n - Internal variables: `L`, used to store the length of the string; `pt`, a pointer to the string; `pos`, an index for traversing the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, the starting address of the string `str` is obtained via `ADR(str)` and assigned to the pointer variable `pt`. Then, the length of the string is obtained using `LEN(str)` and assigned to the variable `L`.\n\n-- REGION String Traversal\n   A `FOR` loop is used to traverse each character in the string from 1 to the string length `L`. In each iteration:\n   - The current character pointed to by `pt` is checked using `ISC_ALPHA(pt^)`. `ISC_ALPHA` is a hypothetical built-in function that determines whether a character is alphabetic.\n   - If the current character is not a letter, `IS_ALPHA` is set to `FALSE`, and the function immediately returns, terminating execution.\n   - If the current character is a letter, the pointer `pt` is moved one byte forward to point to the next character.\n\n-- REGION Result Return\n   If all characters are letters after the loop completes, the string length `L` is checked to see if it is greater than 0. If the string is not empty, `IS_ALPHA` is set to `TRUE`; otherwise, it is set to `FALSE`. The final value of `IS_ALPHA` is then returned.\n\n- Summary\nThis function traverses each character in the string and uses the `ISC_ALPHA` function to check if the characters are letters, thereby determining whether the string contains only alphabetic characters. Empty strings are considered invalid. The code logic is clear and suitable for scenarios requiring string content validation.", "name": "IS_ALPHA"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a functional block named `CLICK_CNT`, designed to detect the number of clicks on an input signal. When the click count reaches a specified threshold (`N`), the output `Q` becomes `TRUE`. The block also utilizes a timer (of type `TP`) to limit the time interval between clicks.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `N` (click count threshold), `TC` (time limit).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output signal, indicating whether the click count has reached the threshold).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (timer instance), `edge` (used to detect the rising edge of the input signal), `cnt` (click counter, initialized to -1).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n  The core logic of the functional block is as follows:\n  1. **Initialize Output**: Set the output `Q` to `FALSE` initially.\n  2. **Detect Click Start**:\n     - If the input signal `IN` is `TRUE`, `edge` is `FALSE` (indicating a rising edge is detected), and the timer `tx`'s output `Q` is `FALSE` (indicating the timer is not running), reset the counter `cnt` to `0`, marking the start of click detection.\n  3. **Click Counting**:\n     - If the timer `tx`'s output `Q` is `TRUE` (indicating the timer is running), the input signal `IN` is `FALSE`, and `edge` is `TRUE` (indicating a falling edge is detected), increment the counter `cnt` by 1, signifying a detected click.\n  4. **Detect Click Completion**:\n     - If the timer `tx`'s output `Q` is `FALSE` (indicating the timer has stopped), check if the counter `cnt` equals the threshold `N`. If they match, set the output `Q` to `TRUE`, indicating the click count has reached the threshold. Simultaneously, reset the counter `cnt` to `-1` to prepare for the next detection cycle.\n  5. **Update Edge Detection**: Store the current value of the input signal `IN` into `edge` for edge detection in the next cycle.\n  6. **Timer Control**: Invoke the timer `tx`, passing the input signal `IN` and the time limit `TC` to the timer to control the click interval.\n\n- Summary\n  This functional block precisely counts clicks by detecting the rising and falling edges of the input signal, combined with timer control. When the click count reaches the specified threshold, the output `Q` becomes `TRUE`. The use of the timer ensures that clicks must occur within the defined time interval; otherwise, the counter resets.", "name": "CLICK_CNT"}

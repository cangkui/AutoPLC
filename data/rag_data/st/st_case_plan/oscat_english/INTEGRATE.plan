Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements an integration function block designed to perform integral operations on an input signal. It uses the trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral value and controls the integration start/stop via an enable signal. The function block's output is the integral value of the input signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Enable signal (E), input signal (X), integration coefficient (K).\n  - Input/output variable: Integration result (Y).\n  - Internal variables: Last input value (X_last), initialization flag (init), last timestamp (last), current timestamp (tx).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     During the first run of the function block, the initialization flag (init) is false, so the initialization logic is executed. This includes:\n     - Setting the initialization flag (init) to true, indicating initialization is complete.\n     - Setting the last input value (X_last) to the current input value (X).\n     This ensures proper initialization on the first run.\n\n  -- REGION Integration Calculation\n     If the enable signal (E) is true, the integration calculation logic is executed. The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral value using the formula:\n     \\[\n     Y = \\frac{(X + X_{last})}{2} \\cdot \\Delta t \\cdot K + Y\n     \\]\n     Where:\n     - \\(X\\) is the current input value.\n     - \\(X_{last}\\) is the last input value.\n     - \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time difference between the current timestamp (tx) and the last timestamp (last), converted to a real number.\n     - \\(K\\) is the integration coefficient.\n     - \\(Y\\) is the current integration result.\n     After calculation, the last input value (X_last) is updated to the current input value (X).\n\n  -- REGION Timestamp Update\n     After each integration calculation, the last timestamp (last) is updated to the current timestamp (tx). This ensures the correct time difference is calculated in the next iteration.\n\n- Output\n  The integration result (Y) is the function block's output, representing the integral value of the input signal. If the enable signal (E) is false, the integration result remains unchanged.", "name": "INTEGRATE"}

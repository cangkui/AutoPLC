{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `EXP10`, which calculates the base-10 exponential function, i.e., \\(10^X\\). The function leverages the natural exponential function `EXP` by applying the mathematical formula \\(10^X = e^{X \\cdot \\ln(10)}\\), where \\(\\ln(10)\\) is approximately 2.30258509299405.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following variable type:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value for the exponential function.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute \\(10^X\\)\n      The core logic of the function uses the natural exponential function `EXP` to compute \\(10^X\\). The specific steps are as follows:\n      1. Multiply the input value `X` by \\(\\ln(10)\\) (i.e., 2.30258509299405) to obtain an intermediate result.\n      2. Pass the intermediate result as an argument to the natural exponential function `EXP` to compute \\(e^{X \\cdot \\ln(10)}\\), which is equivalent to \\(10^X\\).\n      3. Assign the computed result to the function output `EXP10`.\n\n  Example:\n  If the input is `X = 2`, the calculation proceeds as follows:\n  \\[\n  EXP10 = EXP(2 \\cdot 2.30258509299405) = EXP(4.6051701859881) \\approx 100\n  \\]\n  The final result is 100, i.e., \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\n  This function simplifies implementation by transforming the base-10 exponential operation into a natural exponential operation using mathematical conversion.", "name": "EXP10"}

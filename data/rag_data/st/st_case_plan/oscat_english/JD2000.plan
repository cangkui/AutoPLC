{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `JD2000` that converts an input time of type `TIME` into Julian Day (JD) format, with the reference time set to January 1, 2000, 00:00:00. Julian Day is a commonly used time representation in astronomy, indicating the number of days elapsed since a specific reference time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `DTI`, of type `TIME`, representing the input time value.\n  - Output variable: `JD2000`, of type `REAL`, representing the calculated Julian Day value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The function's logic is as follows:\n     1. Convert the input `TIME` value `DTI` into a `DWORD` type, resulting in an integer value in milliseconds.\n     2. Subtract `946728000` from this integer value, which represents the number of milliseconds corresponding to the reference time (January 1, 2000, 00:00:00).\n     3. Divide the difference by `86400.0` to convert milliseconds into days (1 day = 86400 seconds).\n     4. Assign the final result to `JD2000`, representing the number of days elapsed since January 1, 2000, 00:00:00.\n\n  The core idea of this code is to convert a time value into the number of days relative to the reference time, facilitating time-related calculations or comparisons.", "name": "JD2000"}

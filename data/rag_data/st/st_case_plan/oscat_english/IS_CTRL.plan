{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `IS_CTRL` to check whether all characters in the input string are control characters. Control characters refer to those with ASCII codes between 0 and 31, as well as 127 (the DEL character). If all characters in the string are control characters, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `STR`, a string-type input parameter used to pass the string to be checked.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `L`: Stores the length of the string.\n    - `pt`: A byte pointer used to traverse each character in the string.\n    - `pos`: A loop counter indicating the current character position being checked.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the code retrieves the starting address of the string `STR` using `ADR(STR)` and assigns it to the pointer `pt`. Then, it obtains the length of the string using `LEN(STR)` and stores it in the variable `L`.\n\n  -- REGION Character Check\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string, running from 1 to the string length `L`. In each iteration:\n    - The function `ISC_CTRL(pt^)` checks whether the current character is a control character. `ISC_CTRL` is a hypothetical function that determines if a character is a control character.\n    - If the current character is not a control character, the function return value `IS_CTRL` is set to `FALSE`, and the function immediately exits.\n    - If the current character is a control character, the pointer `pt` is incremented by 1 to proceed to the next character.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    If the loop completes and all characters are control characters, the function return value `IS_CTRL` is set to `TRUE`. Additionally, if the string length `L` is 0 (i.e., an empty string), the function returns `FALSE` since an empty string contains no control characters.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this code is to traverse each character in the string and verify whether it is a control character. If all characters are control characters and the string is not empty, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`. This logic is suitable for scenarios where string content needs to be validated against specific conditions.", "name": "IS_CTRL"}

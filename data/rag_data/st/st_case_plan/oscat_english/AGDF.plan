Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `AGDF` that calculates a mathematical expression and returns the result. The input to the function is a real number `X`, and the output is also a real number. The core logic of the function is to compute the expression `LN((1.0 + SIN(X)) / COS(X))`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value to the function.\n  - Output variable: `AGDF`, of type `REAL`, representing the return value of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Compute Expression\nThe function's logic is very straightforwardâ€”it directly computes the expression `LN((1.0 + SIN(X)) / COS(X))` and assigns the result to `AGDF`. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Compute `SIN(X)`, which is the sine of `X`.\n    2. Compute `COS(X)`, which is the cosine of `X`.\n    3. Divide the result of `1.0 + SIN(X)` by `COS(X)`.\n    4. Take the natural logarithm `LN` of the above result.\n    5. Assign the final result to `AGDF` as the function's return value.\n\n    This expression might be used in certain mathematical or engineering calculations, and its specific application scenario would depend on the context.", "name": "AGDF"}

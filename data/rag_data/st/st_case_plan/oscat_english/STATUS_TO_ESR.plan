{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple SCL function named `STATUS_TO_ESR`, designed to convert input status, address, date-time, and timestamp into an `esr_data` structure. Depending on the status value, the function sets the `typ` field to different values and maps the input data to the output structure.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `status` (status value, type `BYTE`), `adress` (address, type `STRING[10]`), `DT_in` (date-time, type `DT`), `TS` (timestamp, type `TIME`).\n - Output variable: The function returns an `esr_data` structure containing the fields `typ`, `adress`, `DS`, `TS`, and `data`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Status Type Determination:\n   The function first determines the `typ` field based on the value of `status`:\n   - If `status` is less than 100, `typ` is set to 1.\n   - If `status` is between 100 and 199, `typ` is set to 2.\n   - If `status` is 200 or greater, `typ` is set to 3.\n   This logic is typically used to categorize statuses, such as \"normal,\" \"warning,\" and \"error.\"\n\n-- REGION Data Mapping:\n   Next, the function maps the input data to the corresponding fields in the `esr_data` structure:\n   - The `adress` field directly maps to the input `adress` string.\n   - The `DS` field maps to the input `DT_in` (date-time).\n   - The `TS` field maps to the input `TS` (timestamp).\n   - The first element of the `data` array (`data[0]`) is set to the input `status` value.\n\n-- REGION Return Result:\n   The function ultimately returns the `esr_data` structure, which contains all fields calculated and mapped from the input data.\n\n- Summary\nThe primary purpose of this function is to encapsulate input status, address, date-time, and timestamp into a structured output while categorizing the type based on the status value. Such functions are commonly used in data logging or status monitoring systems to uniformly process different types of status information.", "name": "STATUS_TO_ESR"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block named `IRTRANS_DECODE` is used to decode infrared remote control commands received from the network buffer. It extracts the device name and key information from the buffer and stores the decoded results in output variables. If decoding is successful, it sets `CMD` to true; otherwise, it sets `ERROR` to true.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output variables: `IP_C` (IP control structure) and `R_BUF` (network buffer).\n - Output variables: `CMD` (command flag), `DEV` (device name), `KEY` (key name), and `ERROR` (error flag).\n - Internal variables: `i` (loop counter), `stop` (stop condition), `pt` (pointer for string access), `buffer` (pointer for buffer access), `size` (buffer size), and `z` (temporary byte variable).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization and Condition Check\n   - First, retrieve the size `size` of the network buffer.\n   - Check if the buffer is not empty and if the value of `IP_C.MAILBOX[1]` has changed. If the conditions are met, proceed with decoding; otherwise, set `error` to false, `cmd` to false, and return immediately.\n\n-- REGION Device Name Decoding\n   - Initialize the loop counter `i` to 0 and set `stop` to `size - 2`.\n   - Use pointer `pt` to point to the address of the `dev` string and `buffer` to point to the address of `R_BUF.BUFFER`.\n   - Traverse the buffer until encountering a comma (ASCII code 44) or reaching `stop`. Copy the bytes from the buffer to `dev` and update the pointers.\n   - Append a null terminator `0` at the end of the `dev` string.\n\n-- REGION Key Name Decoding\n   - Update the value of `i` to skip the comma.\n   - Use pointer `pt` to point to the address of the `key` string.\n   - Continue traversing the buffer, copying the remaining bytes to `key`, and updating the pointers.\n   - Append a null terminator `0` at the end of the `key` string.\n\n-- REGION Decoding Result Verification\n   - Check if the last two bytes in the buffer are carriage return (ASCII code 13) and line feed (ASCII code 10). If not, return immediately.\n   - Check if the lengths of `dev` and `key` are zero. If either length is zero, return immediately.\n   - If all checks pass, set `cmd` to true and `error` to false.\n\n-- REGION State Update\n   - Update the value of `z` to `IP_C.MAILBOX[1]` to detect changes in the next call.", "name": "IRTRANS_DECODE"}

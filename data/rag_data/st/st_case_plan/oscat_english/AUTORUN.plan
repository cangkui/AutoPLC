{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a functional block named 'AUTORUN,' designed to control the automatic operation logic of an output signal (OUT). It combines timers, input signals, and state control to ensure the output signal can start and stop automatically under specific conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: IN (input signal), TEST (test signal), ARE (auto-run enable), TRUN (run time), TOFF (stop time)\n - Input/output variable: ARX (auto-run status)\n - Output variables: OUT (output signal), ARO (auto-run output)\n - Internal variables: timer (timer instance), val (stores the timer's output value)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Timer Control\n   This region manages the timer's behavior. First, it checks if the stop time (TOFF) is greater than 0 seconds. If true, it starts the timer and selects either the run time (TRUN) or stop time (TOFF) as the trigger time based on the current output state (OUT). The timer's output value (RMP) is stored in the variable `val`. If TOFF is not greater than 0 seconds, `val` is set to 255 (indicating the timer is inactive).\n-- REGION Auto-Run Logic\n   This region handles the auto-run logic. It first checks if the auto-run conditions are met: ARX (auto-run status) is false, ARE (auto-run enable) is true, and the timer output `val` is 0. If these conditions are satisfied or the test signal (TEST) is true, `val` is set to 0, and ARO (auto-run output) and ARX (auto-run status) are set to true. If `val` is 255 and ARO is true, ARO and ARX are set to false, indicating the auto-run has ended.\n-- REGION Output Control\n   This region controls the output signal (OUT). If the input signal (IN) is true or the auto-run output (ARO) is true, the output signal (OUT) is set to true. Otherwise, OUT remains false.\n\n- Summary\nThe 'AUTORUN' functional block implements automatic operation logic for the output signal using timers and state control. It enables the output signal to start and stop automatically under specific conditions and supports a test mode. The timer manages run and stop durations, while state variables (ARX and ARO) track the current auto-run status.", "name": "AUTORUN"}

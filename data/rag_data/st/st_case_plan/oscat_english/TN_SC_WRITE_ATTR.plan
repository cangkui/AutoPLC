{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `TN_SC_WRITE_ATTR`, which is used to write a specified attribute value (`Iby_ATTR`) to a designated position (`Iin_X`, `Iin_Y`) in the screen buffer (`Xus_TN_SCREEN`). If the coordinates are invalid, the function returns immediately without performing any operation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `Iin_X` and `Iin_Y` represent the coordinate positions on the screen, and `Iby_ATTR` represents the attribute value to be written.\n  - Internal variable: `in_Offset` is used to calculate the offset within the screen buffer.\n  - Struct variable: `Xus_TN_SCREEN` is a screen buffer structure containing a `bya_COLOR` array, which stores the attribute values for each screen position.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Coordinate Validation\n    First, the `TN_SC_XY_ERROR` function is called to verify whether `Iin_X` and `Iin_Y` are valid. If the coordinates are invalid (e.g., out of screen bounds), the function returns immediately without proceeding further. This is a defensive programming strategy to ensure the code does not attempt to access invalid memory locations.\n  -- REGION Offset Calculation\n    If the coordinates are valid, the offset within the screen buffer is calculated. Assuming the screen width is 80 columns, the offset is computed as: `in_Offset = (Iin_Y * 80) + Iin_X`. This offset is used to locate the specific position in the `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_COLOR` array.\n  -- REGION Attribute Writing\n    Finally, the value of `Iby_ATTR` is written to `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_COLOR[in_Offset]`, completing the update of the attribute at the specified screen position.\n\n- Summary\n  The core functionality of this code is to write a specified attribute value to a designated position in the screen buffer, with prior validation of coordinate validity. By calculating the offset, it efficiently accesses specific positions in the screen buffer. This design is suitable for scenarios requiring frequent updates to screen attributes, such as text editors or graphical interfaces.", "name": "TN_SC_WRITE_ATTR"}

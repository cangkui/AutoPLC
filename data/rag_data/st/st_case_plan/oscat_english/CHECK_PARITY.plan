{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `CHECK_PARITY` is used to calculate the parity bit of a `DWORD` type input value. The parity bit helps detect errors that may occur during data transmission. The function checks each bit of the input value and returns a Boolean based on the parity of its binary digits.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `in`: A `DWORD` type input value representing the data for which parity needs to be calculated.\n    - `p`: A `BOOL` type input value representing the current parity bit (could be an initial or predefined value).\n  - Output variables:\n    - `CHECK_PARITY`: A `BOOL` type return value representing the computed parity bit.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    At the start of the function, `CHECK_PARITY` is initialized as `NOT p`, i.e., the inverse of the input parameter `p`. This step may adjust the initial parity bit or prepare for subsequent calculations.\n  -- REGION Parity Calculation\n    A `WHILE` loop is used to check each bit of the input value `in`. The loop condition is `in > 0`, meaning the loop continues as long as `in` is not zero.\n    - Within the loop, the value of `CHECK_PARITY` is updated bitwise using the `XOR` (exclusive OR) operation. Specifically, `CHECK_PARITY` is XORed with the lowest 4 bits of `in` (`in.0`, `in.1`, `in.2`, `in.3`) to compute the parity of the current bits.\n    - After each iteration, `in` is right-shifted by 4 bits using the `SHR` operation to process the next 4 bits.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    Once the loop ends, the value of `CHECK_PARITY` represents the parity bit of the input value `in`, and the function returns this value.\n\n- Summary\n  This function calculates the parity bit of the input value `in` through bitwise XOR operations and returns the result. It is suitable for scenarios requiring data integrity checks, such as verifying whether data has been corrupted during transmission in communication protocols.", "name": "CHECK_PARITY"}

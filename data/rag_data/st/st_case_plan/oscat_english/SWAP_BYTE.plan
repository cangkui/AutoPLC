Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `SWAP_BYTE`, and its purpose is to swap the high byte and low byte of an input 16-bit word (WORD), then return the swapped result. This operation is commonly used to handle endianness issues, such as data exchange between big-endian and little-endian systems.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `WORD`, representing the input 16-bit word.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function is very simple. It uses the `ROL` (rotate left) instruction to left-shift the input `IN` value by 8 bits. Since `IN` is a 16-bit word, shifting it left by 8 bits will swap the positions of the high byte and low byte. For example, if the input is `0xAABB`, left-shifting by 8 bits will turn it into `0xBBAA`. Finally, the function returns the swapped result.\n\n    Examples:\n    - If the input is `IN = 0xAABB`, then `SWAP_BYTE` returns `0xBBAA`.\n    - If the input is `IN = 0x1234`, then `SWAP_BYTE` returns `0x3412`.\n\n    This operation is particularly useful when dealing with data of different endianness, such as in network communication or cross-platform data transfer.", "name": "SWAP_BYTE"}

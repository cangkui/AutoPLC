{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `FINDB` used to search for the position of substring `str2` in string `str1` from the end to the beginning. If the substring is found, it returns the starting position; otherwise, it returns 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `str1` and `str2`, representing the main string and the substring to be searched, respectively.\n  - Internal variables: `pos` records the current search position, and `length` stores the length of the substring.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n      First, calculate the length of substring `str2` and store it in the variable `length`.\n  -- REGION Substring Search\n      Use a `FOR` loop to traverse the main string `str1` from the end to the beginning, checking if the substring starting from the current position matches `str2`. If a match is found, assign the current position to `FindB` and return it. If no matching substring is found after traversing the entire string, return 0.", "name": "FINDB"}

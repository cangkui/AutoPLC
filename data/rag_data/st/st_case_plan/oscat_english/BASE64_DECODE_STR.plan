{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a functional block named `BASE64_DECODE_STR`, designed to decode a Base64-encoded string back into its original string form. It processes the input string in chunks, decoding it step by step and outputting the result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `RUN`, used to initiate the decoding process.\n  - Output variable: `DONE`, indicating whether the decoding process is complete.\n  - Input/output variables: `STR1` (Base64-encoded input string) and `STR2` (decoded output string).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `BASE64_DECODE_STREAM`: A stream-processing functional block that performs Base64 decoding.\n    - `run_last`: Used to detect the rising edge of the `RUN` signal.\n    - `buf1` and `buf2`: Byte buffers for storing input and output data, respectively.\n    - `mode`: A state machine representing the current decoding mode.\n    - `size1` and `size2`: Represent the sizes of the input and output buffers, respectively.\n    - `end` and `pos`: Track the processing position within the input string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Mode 0\n    This is the initial state, waiting for the rising edge of the `RUN` signal to start decoding. When the rising edge is detected:\n    - `DONE` is set to `FALSE`, indicating the start of decoding.\n    - `mode` is set to 1, transitioning to the decoding processing mode.\n    - `end` is initialized to the length of the input string `STR1`, and `pos` is set to 0, starting from the beginning of the string.\n    - The output string `STR2` is cleared to prepare for the decoded content.\n\n  -- REGION Mode 1\n    This is the core decoding logic, responsible for processing the input string in chunks:\n    - The current chunk size `size1` is calculated as the minimum of the remaining input string and the buffer size.\n    - If `size1` is greater than 0 (indicating data remains to be processed):\n      - `OSCAT_BASIC._STRING_TO_BUFFER` copies a portion of the input string into the `buf1` buffer.\n      - The `BASE64_DECODE_STREAM` functional block is called to decode the Base64 data in `buf1` into `buf2`, returning the decoded data size `size2`.\n      - `OSCAT_BASIC.BUFFER_TO_STRING` converts the decoded data in `buf2` into a string and appends it to the output string `STR2`.\n    - If `size1` is 0 (indicating the input string has been fully processed):\n      - `mode` is set back to 0, returning to the initial state.\n      - `DONE` is set to `TRUE`, signaling the completion of decoding.\n    - `pos` is updated to point to the next position in the input string for processing.\n\n  -- REGION End Logic\n    At the end of each cycle, `run_last` is updated to record the current state of the `RUN` signal for detecting the next rising edge.\n\n- Summary\nThe `BASE64_DECODE_STR` functional block uses a state machine (`mode`) and chunked processing to gradually decode a Base64-encoded string into its original form. It leverages the `BASE64_DECODE_STREAM` block for actual decoding and signals completion via the `DONE` flag. The code is well-structured and suitable for handling large Base64-encoded strings.", "name": "BASE64_DECODE_STR"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block `FT_IMP` that implements an improved version of a first-order lag element (PT1). It calculates the difference between the input signal and the PT1 output, then multiplies it by a gain coefficient `K` to produce the final output value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` (input signal, type `REAL`), `T` (time constant, type `TIME`), `K` (gain coefficient, type `REAL`, default value `1.0`).\n  - Output variable: `out` (output signal, type `REAL`).\n  - Internal variable: `t1` (an instance of type `FT_PT1`, used to implement the first-order lag element).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     1. **PT1 Calculation**: Calls the `FT_PT1` function block `t1`, passing the input signal `in` and time constant `T` to compute the first-order lag output `t1.out`.\n     2. **Difference Calculation and Gain**: Computes the difference between the input signal `in` and `t1.out`, then multiplies the result by the gain coefficient `K` to obtain the final output value `out`.\n\n  The core logic of this code involves processing the input signal through the `FT_PT1` function block for first-order lag, then generating the final output by calculating the difference between the input and lagged output and applying the gain. This structure can be used in signal processing scenarios such as filtering or dynamic compensation.", "name": "FT_IMP"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `NEGX`, which calculates and returns the negation of an input real number. The function is very simple, consisting of only one input variable and one output logic.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input real number.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of the function is to negate the input real number `X` and assign the result to the function's return value `NEGX`. This is achieved through the expression `NEGX := -X`, which multiplies the value of `X` by `-1` to obtain its negation.\n  \n     For example, if the input `X` is `3.14`, then `NEGX` will be `-3.14`; if the input `X` is `-5.0`, then `NEGX` will be `5.0`.\n\n- Output Result\n  The return value `NEGX` is the negation of the input `X`, with a type of `REAL`.\n\nSummary:\n  This function is a very basic mathematical operation, suitable for scenarios where the negation of a real number needs to be calculated. Its implementation is straightforward and the logic is clear.", "name": "NEGX"}

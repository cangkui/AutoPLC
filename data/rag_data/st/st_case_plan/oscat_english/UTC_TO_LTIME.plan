{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `UTC_TO_LTIME`, which converts UTC time to local time. The conversion takes into account timezone offset and Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `UTC` (UTC time), `DST_ENABLE` (whether DST is enabled), `TIME_ZONE_OFFSET` (timezone offset in hours).\n  - Internal variable: `tmp` (a temporary variable storing the time offset in seconds).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate Time Offset\n  First, the total offset between local time and UTC time is calculated. The offset consists of two parts:\n  1. Timezone offset: Convert `TIME_ZONE_OFFSET` from hours to seconds (multiply by 60).\n  2. DST offset: If DST is enabled (`DST_ENABLE` is true) and the current UTC time falls within the DST period (determined by `DST(UTC)`), add 3600 seconds (1 hour).\n  These two offsets are summed and stored in the `tmp` variable.\n\n-- REGION Adjust UTC Time\n  Based on the value of `tmp`, adjust the UTC time to obtain local time:\n  - If `tmp` is negative, it means local time is earlier than UTC time. Take the absolute value of `tmp` and subtract this offset from the UTC time.\n  - If `tmp` is positive, it means local time is later than UTC time. Directly add the offset to the UTC time.\n  The `UTC` time is converted to DWORD type for calculation using `DT_TO_DWORD` and `DWORD_TO_DT` functions, and then converted back to DT type.\n\n-- REGION Return Result\n  The calculated local time is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Summary\nThis function efficiently converts UTC time to local time by combining timezone offset and DST adjustments. Through straightforward mathematical operations and type conversions, it achieves reliable time conversion logic.", "name": "UTC_TO_LTIME"}

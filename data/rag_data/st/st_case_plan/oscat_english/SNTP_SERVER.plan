{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `SNTP_SERVER`, which implements a simple SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) server. The block processes network packets to respond to SNTP requests and returns the current timestamp. It uses a state machine to manage the SNTP server's state and employs network buffers for data transmission and reception.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - InOut Variables: `IP_C` (IP control structure), `S_BUF` (send buffer), `R_BUF` (receive buffer), used for managing network communication-related data.\n  - Input Variables: `ENABLE` (enable signal), `STRATUM` (SNTP stratum level), `UDT` (current date and time), `XMS` (current milliseconds), used to control the block's operation and provide time information.\n  - Local Variables: `IP_FIFO` (IP FIFO structure), `ip_state` (IP state), `ip_id` (IP ID), `i2` and `i` (loop counters), `timestamp_int` (timestamp integer part), `timestamp_sek` (timestamp fractional part), `ts_b` (timestamp bytes), `state` (state machine state), `tx` (current time), `t` (timer), used to manage the block's internal logic and state.\n\n- - Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION State Machine\n    The state machine is the core logic of the functional block, managing the SNTP server's different states and operations. Below is the detailed logic for each state:\n    - State 00: Initialization State\n      - Checks if the `ENABLE` input is true. If true, the block is enabled, and it transitions to state 10.\n      - Sets `ip_state` to 1, indicating the IP layer initialization has started.\n      - The primary purpose of this state is to wait for the block to be enabled and initiate the IP layer initialization.\n\n    - State 10: Wait for IP Layer Initialization Completion\n      - Checks if `ip_state` is 3. If it is, the IP layer is ready, and SNTP server operations can begin.\n      - Configures the following parameters for `IP_C`:\n        - `C_PORT` to 123, the port number used by the SNTP server.\n        - `C_IP` to 0, indicating the default IP address.\n        - `C_MODE` to 5, specifying the IP layer's operating mode.\n        - `C_ENABLE` to true, enabling the IP layer.\n        - `TIME_RESET` to true, resetting the IP layer's time.\n        - `R_OBSERVE` to false, indicating no observation of the receive buffer.\n      - Clears the sizes of the send buffer `S_BUF` and receive buffer `R_BUF`, marking them as empty.\n      - Transitions to state 20, indicating the SNTP server is ready to handle requests.\n\n    - State 20: Process SNTP Requests\n      - Checks if the receive buffer `R_BUF.SIZE` is greater than 0. If so, there is an SNTP request to process.\n      - Uses a `FOR` loop to clear the first 48 bytes of the receive buffer, ensuring no interference with subsequent operations.\n      - Constructs the SNTP response packet:\n        - Sets the SNTP packet header:\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[0]` to `2#11100`, representing the SNTP packet's version and mode.\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[1]` to `STRATUM`, indicating the SNTP server's stratum level.\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[2]` to `BYTE#10`, specifying the SNTP packet's polling interval.\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[3]` to `BYTE#16#FB`, denoting the SNTP packet's precision.\n        - Calculates the timestamp:\n          - `timestamp_int` converts the current date and time `UDT` to SNTP timestamp format using the `DT_TO_DWORD` function, adding `DWORD#2208988800` (the NTP timestamp baseline).\n          - `timestamp_sek` converts the current milliseconds `XMS` to the fractional part of the SNTP timestamp using the `DINT_TO_DWORD` function.\n        - Fills the timestamp bytes into specific positions in the send buffer:\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[16..19]`, `S_BUF.BUFFER[32..35]`, and `S_BUF.BUFFER[40..43]` store the 4 bytes of `timestamp_int`.\n          - `S_BUF.BUFFER[20..21]`, `S_BUF.BUFFER[36..37]`, and `S_BUF.BUFFER[44..45]` store the 2 bytes of `timestamp_sek`.\n        - Copies part of the receive buffer data to the send buffer to populate the remaining parts of the SNTP packet.\n      - Sets the send buffer `S_BUF.SIZE` to 48 bytes, indicating the SNTP response packet is ready for transmission.\n      - If `ENABLE` is false and the send buffer is empty, the block is disabled, `ip_state` is set to 4, and it returns to state 00 to await re-enabling.\n\n  -- REGION Timer\n    - The timer `t` detects IP layer errors. If `IP_C.ERROR` is greater than 0, an IP layer error has occurred, and the timer starts.\n    - When the timer expires (5 seconds), `IP_C.TIME_RESET` is set to true to reset the IP layer's time.\n    - This logic handles IP layer error recovery, ensuring the SNTP server can automatically recover from network anomalies.\n\n  -- REGION IP FIFO\n    - Uses the `IP_FIFO` function to manage the IP layer's FIFO queue, updating the IP layer's state based on `ip_state` and `ip_id`.\n    - The `IP_FIFO` function manages the IP layer's data flow, ensuring packets are correctly sent and received.\n    - Through the `ip_state` and `ip_id` parameters, the block controls the IP layer's state transitions, ensuring the SNTP server works in sync with the network layer.\n\n  By combining the state machine, timer, and IP FIFO, the functional block effectively manages the SNTP server's operation, handles network packet transmission and reception, and automatically recovers from network issues.", "name": "SNTP_SERVER"}

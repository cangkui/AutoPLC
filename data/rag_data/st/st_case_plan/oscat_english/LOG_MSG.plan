{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block `LOG_MSG` is designed to handle log messages. It prints log messages to the output by calling an instance of `PRINT_SF` and stores messages into a log buffer based on certain conditions. Additionally, it manages the logic for updating and resetting the log buffer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n1. `FB_PRINT_SF`: An instance of the `PRINT_SF` function block, used for printing log messages.\n2. `idX`: An integer variable that stores the current index of the log message.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Log Message Filtering\nFirst, the code checks whether the priority of the log message is higher than the current log level. This is done by left-shifting `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG_OPTION` by 16 bits, converting it to a byte, and comparing it with `LOG_CL.LEVEL`. If the message priority is lower than or equal to the log level, the function returns immediately without processing the message.\n\n-- REGION Log Message Printing\nIf the message meets the priority condition, the `FB_PRINT_SF` instance is called to print the log message to the output. The `PRINTF_DATA` parameter passes `LOG_CL.PRINTF`, and the `STR` parameter passes `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG`.\n\n-- REGION Log Buffer Reset\nIf `LOG_CL.RESET` is true, the log buffer's state is reset. Specific operations include:\n1. Setting `LOG_CL.RESET` to `FALSE` to indicate the reset is complete.\n2. Setting `LOG_CL.RING_MODE` to `FALSE` to exit ring buffer mode.\n3. Resetting `LOG_CL.IDX` to `0` to start storing new messages from the beginning of the buffer.\n4. Incrementing `LOG_CL.UPDATE_COUNT` by `1` to indicate an increase in buffer update count.\n\n-- REGION Log Message Storage\nIf the log buffer size `LOG_CL.SIZE` is greater than `0` and the new message `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG` has a length greater than `0`, the following logic is executed:\n1. Check if the current index `LOG_CL.IDX` is greater than or equal to the buffer size. If true, it means the buffer is full, and ring buffer mode is activated:\n   - Set `LOG_CL.RING_MODE` to `TRUE`.\n   - Reset `LOG_CL.IDX` to `0` to start overwriting old messages from the beginning.\n2. Update the log buffer's state:\n   - Increment `LOG_CL.UPDATE_COUNT` by `1` to indicate an increase in buffer update count.\n   - Increment `LOG_CL.IDX` by `1` to point to the next storage position.\n   - Set `idX` to the current index value.\n   - Store the new message `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG` into the `LOG_CL.MSG` array at the current index position.\n   - Store the message option `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG_OPTION` into the `LOG_CL.MSG_OPTION` array at the current index position.\n   - Clear `LOG_CL.NEW_MSG` to indicate the message has been processed.", "name": "LOG_MSG"}

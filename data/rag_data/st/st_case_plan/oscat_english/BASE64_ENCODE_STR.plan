{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function block named `BASE64_ENCODE_STR`, which performs Base64 encoding on the input string `STR1` and stores the result in `STR2`. The function block processes the input in chunks, enabling support for handling longer strings efficiently.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `RUN`, used to initiate the encoding process.\n  - Output variable: `DONE`, indicating whether encoding is complete.\n  - Input/output variables: `STR1` (input string) and `STR2` (output string).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `BASE64_ENCODE_STREAM`: A sub-function block called for Base64 encoding.\n    - `run_last`: Used to detect the rising edge of the `RUN` signal.\n    - `buf1` and `buf2`: Byte arrays for storing input and output data, respectively.\n    - `mode`: Tracks the current processing phase.\n    - `size1` and `size2`: Represent the sizes of input and output chunks.\n    - `end` and `pos`: Track the processing position within the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Mode Control\n    The function block uses the `mode` variable to manage different stages of encoding:\n    - **Mode 0**: Initialization phase. Upon detecting a rising edge of `RUN`, it initializes the encoding process. Sets `DONE` to `FALSE`, switches `mode` to 1, calculates the input string length `end`, and resets the processing position `pos` to 0. It also clears the output string `STR2`.\n    - **Mode 1**: Encoding phase. Extracts up to 48 characters (`size1`) from `STR1`, converts them to byte array `buf1`, and calls `BASE64_ENCODE_STREAM` to encode `buf1`, storing the result in `buf2`. The encoded `buf2` is converted to a string and appended to `STR2`. If all characters are processed (`size1 <= 0`), `mode` is reset to 0, and `DONE` is set to `TRUE` to signal completion. Otherwise, `pos` is updated for the next iteration.\n\n  -- REGION Signal Detection\n    At the end of each cycle, the current `RUN` signal value is stored in `run_last` to detect its rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block efficiently handles Base64 encoding of long strings through chunked processing, supports incremental progress tracking, and ensures correctness via `mode` and `RUN` signal control. The code is well-structured, balancing clarity and performance.", "name": "BASE64_ENCODE_STR"}

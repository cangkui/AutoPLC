Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `_BUFFER_UPPERCASE`, which converts byte data in the input buffer to uppercase letters. The function processes each byte in the buffer by converting it to uppercase and ultimately returns a boolean value `TRUE` to indicate successful operation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `PT` is a pointer to a byte array that stores the input buffer data; `SIZE` is an integer representing the size of the buffer.\n  - Internal variables: `pos` is an integer used to track the current processing position.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization:\n     - Initialize `pos` to 0, indicating processing starts from the first byte of the buffer.\n  -- REGION Loop Processing:\n     - Use a `WHILE` loop to iterate through each byte in the buffer until `pos` reaches the buffer size specified by `SIZE`.\n     - Within the loop, call the `TO_UPPER` function to convert the current byte `PT^[pos]` to uppercase.\n     - Increment `pos` to process the next byte.\n  -- REGION Return Result:\n     - After the loop completes, set the function return value `_BUFFER_UPPERCASE` to `TRUE`, indicating the operation was successfully completed.", "name": "_BUFFER_UPPERCASE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function named 'WORD_OF_DWORD', designed to extract a WORD (16-bit) value from a specified position within a DWORD (32-bit) data type. The function takes a DWORD value and a BYTE index as input and returns the corresponding WORD value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` is a DWORD value representing the input double-word data; `N` is a BYTE value indicating the index of the WORD to be extracted.\n  - Output variable: `WORD_OF_DWORD` is a WORD value representing the extracted WORD from the DWORD.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function involves using bit-shifting operations to extract the specified WORD from the DWORD. The steps are as follows:\n    1. First, the input index `N` is left-shifted by 4 bits (equivalent to multiplying by 16), since a WORD occupies 16 bits. This converts the index into the corresponding bit offset.\n    2. Next, a right-shift operation (SHR) is applied to the input DWORD value `in`, moving it right by the calculated offset to position the target WORD in the least significant 16 bits.\n    3. Finally, the DWORD_TO_WORD function is used to convert the right-shifted DWORD value into a WORD type, which is then returned as the result.\n\n    The primary use of this function is to extract specific 16-bit data (WORD) from a larger data block (DWORD), which is particularly useful for bit manipulation or data parsing tasks.", "name": "WORD_OF_DWORD"}

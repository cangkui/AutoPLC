{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple function named 'IP4_CHECK' designed to verify whether two IPv4 addresses belong to the same subnet. It determines this by comparing the results of the bitwise AND operation between the network addresses and the subnet mask.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: NIP (Network IP address), LIP (Local IP address), SM (Subnet Mask)\n - Output variable: IP4_CHECK (Boolean value indicating whether the two IP addresses are in the same subnet)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   This section contains the core logic of the function. First, the function performs a bitwise AND operation on NIP and SM to obtain the subnet address of the network IP. Then, it performs the same bitwise AND operation on LIP and SM to derive the subnet address of the local IP. Finally, it compares these two subnet addresses. If they are equal, the function returns TRUE, indicating that the two IP addresses are in the same subnet; otherwise, it returns FALSE.", "name": "IP4_CHECK"}

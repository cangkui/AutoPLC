{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `MD5_TO_STRH` converts an MD5 hash value (a 16-byte array) into its string representation. MD5 hashes are commonly used for data integrity checks and encryption, with their string representation consisting of each byte converted into two hexadecimal characters.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `MD5`, a 16-byte array representing the MD5 hash value.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `i`: An index variable used for looping.\n    - `tmp`: A temporary variable for storing the high or low 4 bits of a byte.\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the string, used to build the output string character by character.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the pointer `pt` is initialized to point to the starting address of the function's return string. This indicates that writing will begin from the first character of the string.\n\n  -- REGION Loop Processing MD5 Bytes\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each byte in the `MD5` array (16 bytes in total):\n    1. The current byte is right-shifted by 4 bits to extract the high 4 bits, which are stored in `tmp`.\n    2. `tmp` is converted to its corresponding hexadecimal character:\n       - If `tmp` is less than or equal to 9, it is converted to a character between `'0'` and `'9'`.\n       - If `tmp` is greater than 9, it is converted to a character between `'a'` and `'f'` (by adding 87, which is the ASCII value of `'a'` minus 10).\n    3. The converted character is written to the position pointed to by `pt`, and the pointer `pt` is incremented to the next character position.\n    4. The current byte is masked (`AND 2#1111`) to extract the low 4 bits, which are stored in `tmp`.\n    5. `tmp` is converted to its corresponding hexadecimal character using the same method as for the high 4 bits.\n    6. The converted character is written to the position pointed to by `pt`, and the pointer `pt` is incremented to the next character position.\n\n  -- REGION String Termination\n    After the loop completes, the position pointed to by `pt` is set to `0`, indicating the end of the string. This is a C-style string terminator, ensuring the string is properly terminated.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns a string representing the hexadecimal form of the input MD5 hash value. For example, if the input MD5 array is `[0x12, 0x34, 0x56, ...]`, the returned string might be `\"123456...\"`.", "name": "MD5_TO_STRH"}

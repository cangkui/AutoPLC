{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `AIN` and is used to convert an input value of type `DWORD` into an analog value of type `REAL`. The conversion process takes into account the input's bit width, sign bit, and specified high/low ranges. Through bit manipulation and mathematical calculations, the function maps the input integer value to the specified range and determines the sign of the final output based on the sign bit.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in` (the input integer value), `Bits` (the number of significant bits), `sign` (the position of the sign bit, defaulting to 255, indicating unsigned), `low` (the minimum value of the output range), `high` (the maximum value of the output range, defaulting to 10.0).\n - Constants: `ff` (a `DWORD` value with all bits set to 1, used for masking operations).\n - Internal variables: `temp1` and `temp2` (used to temporarily store intermediate results), `sx` (used to store the state of the sign bit).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Sign Bit Handling\n   First, the function checks if the sign bit position is less than 32. If so, it extracts the sign bit via a right-shift operation and stores it in the `sx` variable. If the sign bit position is greater than or equal to 32, `sx` is set to `FALSE` by default, indicating the input value is unsigned.\n-- REGION Significant Bit Extraction\n   Next, the function generates a mask `temp1` via a right-shift operation, which is used to extract the significant bits from the input value. The input value is then bitwise ANDed with the mask to isolate the significant bits, which are stored in `temp2`.\n-- REGION Range Mapping\n   The function converts the extracted significant bits to type `REAL` and performs a linear mapping to the specified high/low range to compute the final analog value. The mapping formula is:\n   ```\n   AIN = (high - low) * DWORD_TO_REAL(temp2) / DWORD_TO_REAL(temp1) + low\n   ```\n-- REGION Sign Handling\n   If `sx` is `TRUE`, indicating the input value is negative, the final result is negated to maintain sign consistency.\n\n- Output\nThe final output of the function is a `REAL` value representing the analog representation of the input value within the specified range. If the input value has a sign bit and is negative, the output value will also be negative.", "name": "AIN"}

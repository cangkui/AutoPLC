{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function `CTANH` is used to calculate the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number. The hyperbolic tangent function for complex numbers is an extension of hyperbolic functions in the complex domain, commonly used in signal processing, control systems, and mathematical analysis. This function takes a complex number as input and returns its hyperbolic tangent value, which is also a complex number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Internal variables: `temp`, `xi2`, `xr2`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  - **Calculate Intermediate Values**:\n    - `xi2` is twice the imaginary part of the input complex number, i.e., `xi2 := 2.0 * x.im`.\n    - `xr2` is twice the real part of the input complex number, i.e., `xr2 := 2.0 * x.re`.\n  - **Calculate Denominator**:\n    - `temp` is the reciprocal of the denominator, calculated as `temp := 1.0 / (COSH(xr2) + COS(xi2))`. Here, the hyperbolic cosine function `COSH` and the cosine function `COS` are used to compute the denominator.\n  - **Calculate Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n    - The real part `CTANH.re` is calculated using the formula `temp * SINH(xr2)`, where `SINH` is the hyperbolic sine function.\n    - The imaginary part `CTANH.im` is calculated using the formula `temp * SIN(xi2)`, where `SIN` is the sine function.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function returns a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are calculated using the above formulas. Mathematically, the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number is defined as:\n\\[\n\\tanh(z) = \\frac{\\sinh(z)}{\\cosh(z)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is a complex number. The implementation of this function processes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number separately to ultimately obtain the hyperbolic tangent value of the complex number.", "name": "CTANH"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function is named `TANH` and is used to calculate the value of the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh). The hyperbolic tangent function is a common mathematical function whose output ranges between -1 and 1. The function takes a real number `X` as input and returns its corresponding hyperbolic tangent value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the real number for which the hyperbolic tangent value is to be calculated.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of this function is to compute the hyperbolic tangent value. The specific implementation is as follows:\n    1. If `X` is greater than 20.0, directly return 1.0. This is because when `X` is sufficiently large, the hyperbolic tangent function approaches 1.0.\n    2. If `X` is less than -20.0, directly return -1.0. This is because when `X` is sufficiently small, the hyperbolic tangent function approaches -1.0.\n    3. If `X` is between -20.0 and 20.0, use the formula `1.0 - 2.0 / (EXP(2.0 * X) + 1.0)` to calculate the hyperbolic tangent value. This formula is the mathematical expression of the hyperbolic tangent function, computed using the exponential function `EXP`.\n\n  This implementation uses segmented processing to ensure both computational accuracy and performance optimization, avoiding unnecessary calculations for extreme values.", "name": "TANH"}

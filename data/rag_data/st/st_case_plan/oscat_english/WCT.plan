  "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `WCT`, calculates the Wind Chill Temperature (WCT), which represents how cold the human body feels when considering both wind speed and actual temperature. The function uses a specific formula to compute WCT based on the input temperature `T` and wind speed `V`. If the wind speed is less than 5.0 or the temperature is greater than 10.0, the function directly returns the input temperature `T`, as the WCT calculation is not applicable under these conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `T` (temperature, type `REAL`) and `V` (wind speed, type `REAL`).\n  - Output variable: `WCT` (wind chill temperature, type `REAL`), which serves as the function's return value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Logic and Calculation\n      The function's logic is divided into two parts:\n      1. **Condition Check**:\n         - If wind speed `V` is less than 5.0 or temperature `T` is greater than 10.0, the function returns the input temperature `T` directly. This is because the WCT formula does not apply under these conditions, and the perceived temperature matches the input temperature.\n      2. **Wind Chill Calculation**:\n         - If the above conditions are not met, the WCT is calculated using the following formula:\n           \\[\n           WCT = 13.12 + 0.6215 \\times T + (0.3965 \\times T - 11.37) \\times V^{0.16}\n           \\]\n           Here, `EXP(LN(v) * 0.16)` is used to compute \\( V^{0.16} \\).\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns `WCT`, the calculated wind chill temperature based on the above logic. If the conditions are met, it returns the input temperature `T`; otherwise, it returns the WCT computed using the formula.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently calculates wind chill temperature through straightforward condition checks and mathematical operations. It is designed for cases where wind speed is ≥ 5.0 and temperature is ≤ 10.0, ensuring applicability and accuracy across different conditions by returning the input temperature otherwise."

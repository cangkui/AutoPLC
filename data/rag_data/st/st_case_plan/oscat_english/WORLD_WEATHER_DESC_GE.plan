{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `WORLD_WEATHER_DESC_GE`, which generates weather descriptions based on weather codes. The function block is primarily used to process weather data and produce corresponding weather description strings based on the input weather codes.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `WW`, used to store world weather data.\n - Input Variables: `ACTIVATE`, used to trigger the function block's processing logic.\n - Internal Variables: `act_last`, used to store the previous activation state; `x` and `y`, used to store coordinates or values; `str`, used to store the generated weather description string; `i`, used for iteration.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Activation Handling\n   This section handles the activation logic of the function block. First, it checks whether `ACTIVATE` is true and `act_last` is false, indicating the function block is activated for the first time. If the condition is met, it initializes the iterator `i` to 0 and starts a loop with the loop variable `y` ranging from 1 to 12. Within the loop, different operations are performed based on the value of `y`:\n   - When `y` is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the value of `WW.DAY[i].WEATHER_CODE` is assigned to `x`.\n   - When `y` is even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the value of `str` is assigned to `WW.DAY[i].WEATHER_DESC`, and `i` is incremented by 1.\n   - When `y` is 11, the value of `WW.CUR.WEATHER_CODE` is assigned to `x`.\n   - When `y` is 12, the value of `str` is assigned to `WW.CUR.WEATHER_DESC`.\n\n   Then, based on the value of `x` (weather code), the corresponding weather description string `str` is generated. If the value of `x` matches any known weather code, `str` is assigned the corresponding description string; otherwise, `str` is set to \"nicht verf√ºgbar\" (not available).\n\n   Finally, the value of `ACTIVATE` is assigned to `act_last` to track the activation state in the next iteration.", "name": "WORLD_WEATHER_DESC_GE"}

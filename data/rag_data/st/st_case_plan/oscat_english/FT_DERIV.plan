{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'FT_DERIV', designed to calculate the derivative (rate of change) of an input signal. It measures the rate of change of the input signal and scales the result using a proportional coefficient `K`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` (input signal), `K` (proportional coefficient, default value 1.0), `run` (operation flag, default value TRUE).\n  - Output variable: `out` (calculated derivative result).\n  - Internal variables: `old` (stores the previous input value), `tx` (current timestamp), `last` (previous timestamp), `init` (initialization flag), `tc` (time difference).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Time Difference Calculation\n    First, the current timestamp (in microseconds) is obtained using the `T_PLC_US()` function and stored in the `tx` variable. Then, the difference between the current timestamp and the previous timestamp `last` is calculated and converted to a real number, stored in `tc`. Finally, `last` is updated to the current timestamp for use in the next calculation.\n  \n  -- REGION Initialization\n    If the `init` flag is FALSE, it indicates the function block has not been initialized. In this case, `init` is set to TRUE, and `old` is initialized to the current input value `in` for subsequent derivative calculations.\n\n  -- REGION Derivative Calculation\n    If the function block is running (`run` is TRUE) and the time difference `tc` is greater than 0.0, the derivative is calculated using the following formula:\n    ```\n    out = (in - old) / tc * 1000000.0 * K\n    ```\n    Here, `(in - old)` represents the change in the input signal, `tc` is the time difference (in microseconds), `1000000.0` converts the time difference from microseconds to seconds, and `K` is the proportional coefficient. After calculation, `old` is updated to the current input value `in` for use in the next calculation.\n  \n  -- REGION Output Handling\n    If the function block is not running (`run` is FALSE) or the time difference `tc` is 0.0, the output `out` is set to 0.0, indicating no derivative is calculated.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block calculates the derivative by measuring the rate of change of the input signal and scales it using the proportional coefficient `K`. It uses timestamps to compute the time difference and performs derivative calculations only when the block is running. If the block is not running or the time difference is zero, the output is set to 0.", "name": "FT_DERIV"}

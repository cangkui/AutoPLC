{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function block `HYST_1` designed to implement a comparison logic with hysteresis characteristics. It compares the input value `In` against the set upper limit `high` and lower limit `low`, outputting boolean values `Q` and `win` to indicate whether the input value is within the hysteresis range or exceeds it.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `In` (input value), `high` (upper limit), `low` (lower limit).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output state, indicating whether the input value is above the upper limit or below the lower limit), `win` (output state, indicating whether the input value is within the hysteresis range).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    This section implements the hysteresis comparison logic:\n    - If the input value `In` is less than the lower limit `low`, the output `Q` is set to `FALSE`, indicating the input is below the lower limit, and `win` is set to `FALSE`, meaning the input is outside the hysteresis range.\n    - If the input value `In` is greater than the upper limit `high`, the output `Q` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the input is above the upper limit, and `win` is set to `FALSE`, meaning the input is outside the hysteresis range.\n    - If the input value `In` is between `low` and `high` (i.e., within the hysteresis range), `win` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the input is within the hysteresis range, while `Q` retains its previous value (i.e., maintaining the prior output state).", "name": "HYST_1"}

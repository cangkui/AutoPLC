{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block `DIMM_I` implements a dimming control logic that supports multiple operation modes, including setting brightness, resetting, single-click, long-press dimming, and double-click. It also supports soft dimming (gradual brightness change) and hard dimming (direct brightness setting), with limits for maximum and minimum brightness.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: Set (SET), brightness value (VAL), input signal (IN), reset (RST), debounce time (T_DEBOUNCE), reconfiguration time (T_RECONFIG), maximum on time (T_ON_MAX), dimming start time (T_DIMM_START), dimming time (T_DIMM), minimum brightness (MIN_ON), maximum brightness (MAX_ON), soft dimming flag (SOFT_DIMM), double-click toggle (DBL_toggle), reset output (RST_OUT).\n - Output variables: Output state (Q), double-click state (DBL).\n - Input/output variables: Output brightness (OUT).\n - Internal variables: Configuration module (config), decoding module (decode), timer (t3), dimming module (dim), dimming direction (dir).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Configuration and Decoding\n   First, the `config` module processes the input signal for debouncing and reconfiguration time. Then, the `decode` module interprets the output of `config` to determine whether it's a single-click, long-press, or double-click.\n\n-- REGION Reset Handling\n   If the `RST` signal is true, the output brightness `OUT` is reset to 0 (if `RST_OUT` is true), and the output state `Q` is set to `FALSE`. The dimming direction `dir` is also set based on the current brightness value `OUT`.\n\n-- REGION Brightness Setting\n   If the `SET` signal is true, the output brightness `OUT` is set to `VAL`, and the output state `Q` is set to `TRUE`. The dimming direction `dir` is also set based on the current brightness value `OUT`.\n\n-- REGION Single-Click Handling\n   If a single-click (`decode.SINGLE`) is detected, the output state `Q` is toggled. If `Q` is `TRUE`, the output brightness `OUT` is constrained between `MIN_ON` and `MAX_ON`. The dimming direction `dir` is also set based on the current brightness value `OUT`.\n\n-- REGION Long-Press Handling\n   If a long-press (`decode.TP_LONG`) is detected, different actions are taken based on the current output state `Q`:\n    - If `Q` is `FALSE`, the `SOFT_DIMM` flag determines whether to perform soft dimming (set `OUT` to 1) or hard dimming (constrain `OUT` between `MIN_ON` and `MAX_ON`), and `Q` is set to `TRUE`.\n    - If `Q` is `TRUE`, the dimming direction `dir` is reversed.\n\n-- REGION Double-Click Handling\n   If `DBL_toggle` is `FALSE`, the double-click state `DBL` is set to `FALSE`. If a double-click (`decode.DOUBLE`) is detected, the double-click state `DBL` is toggled.\n\n-- REGION Dimming Handling\n   The `dim` module adjusts brightness based on the dimming direction `dir`, long-press signal `decode.LONG`, and output state `Q`. The dimming time is controlled by `T_DIMM`, and the result is output to `OUT`.\n\n-- REGION Dimming Direction Adjustment\n   If `OUT` is 0, the dimming direction `dir` is set to `TRUE` (increasing). If `OUT` is 255, `dir` is set to `FALSE` (decreasing).\n\n-- REGION Maximum On-Time Handling\n   If `T_ON_MAX` is greater than 0, the timer `t3` controls the maximum on-time for the output state `Q`. When the timer `t3` expires, the output state `Q` is toggled.", "name": "DIMM_I"}

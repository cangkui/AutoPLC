{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `CMUL`, is used to calculate the product of two complex numbers. The multiplication follows the rules of complex arithmetic, where the real and imaginary parts are computed separately, ultimately returning a new complex number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of complex type (`COMPLEX`), representing the two complex numbers to be multiplied.\n  - Output variable: `CMUL`, also a complex type, representing the result of the multiplication.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Complex Multiplication Calculation\n      The formula for multiplying complex numbers is:\n      \\[\n      (a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (a \\times c - b \\times d) + (a \\times d + b \\times c)i\n      \\]\n      In this function, the real and imaginary parts are computed separately:\n      1. Calculate the real part: `CMUL.re := X.re * Y.re - X.im * Y.im`\n         - This is the real part of the product, i.e., \\(a \\times c - b \\times d\\).\n      2. Calculate the imaginary part: `CMUL.im := X.re * Y.im + X.im * Y.re`\n         - This is the imaginary part of the product, i.e., \\(a \\times d + b \\times c\\).\n      Finally, the function returns `CMUL`, a new complex number with its real and imaginary parts derived from the above calculations.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n      The output of the function is `CMUL`, a complex number containing the real and imaginary parts computed according to the rules of complex multiplication.", "name": "CMUL"}

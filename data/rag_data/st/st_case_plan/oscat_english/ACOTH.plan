Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `ACOTH` to calculate the Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent value. The Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent is one of the inverse functions of hyperbolic functions, commonly used in mathematical and engineering calculations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculating Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent\n     The core logic of the function is to compute the Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent value. The formula is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ACOTH}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x + 1}{x - 1}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Here, `LN` is the natural logarithm function. The code implements this through the following steps:\n     1. Calculate `(x + 1.0) / (x - 1.0)`.\n     2. Take the natural logarithm `LN` of the result.\n     3. Multiply the result by `0.5` to obtain the final Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent value.\n     4. Assign the result to `ACOTH` as the function's return value.\n\n- Notes\n  - The input value `X` must satisfy `|X| > 1`, as the Inverse Hyperbolic Cotangent function is undefined for `|X| <= 1`.\n  - If the value of `X` does not meet this condition, the function may return an invalid result or cause a runtime error.", "name": "ACOTH"}

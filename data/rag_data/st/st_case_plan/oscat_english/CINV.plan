Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `CINV` is used to calculate the reciprocal of a complex number. It takes a complex number as input and returns its reciprocal. The reciprocal of the complex number is computed using a formula, with the real and imaginary parts processed separately.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Local variable: `temp`, of type `REAL`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Reciprocal\n    The function logic consists of the following steps:\n    1. Calculate the square of the modulus of the input complex number, i.e., `temp = X.re * X.re + X.im * X.im`. This serves as the denominator in the reciprocal calculation.\n    2. Calculate the real part of the reciprocal: `CINV.re = X.re / temp`. This is obtained by dividing the real part of the input complex number by the square of the modulus.\n    3. Calculate the imaginary part of the reciprocal: `CINV.im = -X.im / temp`. This is obtained by negating the imaginary part of the input complex number and then dividing by the square of the modulus.\n\n    Finally, the function returns `CINV`, which is the reciprocal of the input complex number `X`.", "name": "CINV"}

  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `MESSAGE_4R` is designed to cycle through four string messages and select the currently displayed message based on a clock signal and timer logic. It uses the input signal `ENQ` to enable/disable the function block and employs a timer `TON` to control the timing of message switching.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `M0`, `M1`, `M2`, `M3` represent the four string messages; `MM` is the maximum message index; `ENQ` is the enable signal; `CLK` is the clock signal; `T1` is the timer's time setting.\n  - Output variables: `MX` is the currently displayed string message; `MN` is the current message index; `TR` is the toggle flag.\n  - Internal variables: `timer` is an instance of the `TON` timer, used to control the time interval between message switches; `edge` detects the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Message Switching Logic\n     - First, initialize the toggle flag `TR` to `FALSE`.\n     - If the enable signal `ENQ` is `TRUE`, proceed with the message switching logic:\n       - Check for either a rising edge of the clock signal `CLK` (via the `edge` variable) or if the timer `timer`'s output `q` is `TRUE`. If either condition is met, perform the following actions:\n         1. Use the `INC1` function to increment the current message index `MN`, cycling back based on the maximum value `MM`.\n         2. Set the toggle flag `TR` to `TRUE` to indicate a message switch has occurred.\n         3. Reset the timer `timer`'s input to `FALSE`.\n         4. Assign the corresponding message from `M0`, `M1`, `M2`, or `M3` to `MX` based on the current message index `MN`.\n       - Update the `edge` variable to record the current state of the clock signal.\n       - Start the timer `timer` with its input set to `CLK` and the time setting to `T1`.\n     - If the enable signal `ENQ` is `FALSE`, reset the output variables:\n       - Set `MX` to an empty string.\n       - Reset `MN` to `0`.",

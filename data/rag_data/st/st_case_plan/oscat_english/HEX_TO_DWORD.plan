{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `HEX_TO_DWORD`, which converts a hexadecimal string (HEX) into a double-word (DWORD) numeric value. The function parses the string character by character, converts each character (whether a digit or a letter) into its corresponding numeric value, and finally combines them into a DWORD value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `Hex`, a string with a maximum length of 20, representing the hexadecimal string to be converted.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the `Hex` string, used to access each character sequentially.\n    - `i`: A loop counter for traversing the string.\n    - `X`: A temporary variable storing the ASCII value of the current character.\n    - `stop`: The length of the string, used to control the loop termination condition.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the pointer `pt` is set to the starting address of the input string `Hex`, and the string length `stop` is obtained to determine the number of loop iterations.\n  \n  -- REGION Loop Processing\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate from 1 to `stop`, processing each character in the string. Within the loop:\n    - The ASCII value of the current character is stored in variable `X`.\n    - Based on the value of `X`, the character type is determined:\n      - If `X` is a digit (ASCII value between 48 and 57), it is converted to its corresponding numeric value (`X - 48`) and merged into `HEX_TO_DWORD` using a left-shift operation (`SHL`).\n      - If `X` is an uppercase letter (ASCII value between 65 and 70), it is converted to its corresponding numeric value (`X - 55`) and merged into `HEX_TO_DWORD` using a left-shift operation.\n      - If `X` is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 102), it is converted to its corresponding numeric value (`X - 87`) and merged into `HEX_TO_DWORD` using a left-shift operation.\n    - The pointer `pt` is moved to the next character position to continue processing the next character.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    After the loop completes, the value stored in `HEX_TO_DWORD` is the converted DWORD value, which the function returns.\n\n- Summary\n  This function parses a hexadecimal string character by character, converts each character into its corresponding numeric value, and combines them into a DWORD value. It is suitable for scenarios where hexadecimal strings need to be converted into numeric values.", "name": "HEX_TO_DWORD"}

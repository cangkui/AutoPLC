{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `DT_TO_SDT` is used to convert time data of type `TIME_DT` into structured date-time data of type `SDT`. The `SDT` type includes information such as year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, and second.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variable: `DTI`, of type `TIME_DT`, represents the date-time data to be converted.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `tmp`, of type `DATE`, stores the date portion extracted from `DTI`.\n    - `tdt`, of type `DWORD`, stores the time portion extracted from `DTI` (in seconds).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Date Extraction and Conversion\n    First, use the `DT_TO_DATE` function to extract the date portion from `DTI` and store it in the `tmp` variable. Then, use the `DT_TO_DWORD` function to convert `DTI` into a `DWORD` type in seconds, subtract the value of `DATE_TO_DWORD(tmp)`, and store the resulting time portion (in seconds) in the `tdt` variable.\n\n  -- REGION Year, Month, Day, and Weekday Extraction\n    Use the `YEAR_OF_DATE`, `MONTH_OF_DATE`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, and `DAY_OF_WEEK` functions to extract the year, month, day, and weekday information from `tmp`, respectively, and assign them to the corresponding fields of `DT_TO_SDT`.\n\n  -- REGION Time Extraction and Conversion\n    Extract the time portion from `tdt`:\n    - Use the `MOD 60` operation to extract the seconds, convert it to `INT` type, and assign it to `DT_TO_SDT.SECOND`.\n    - Use the `(tdt / 60) MOD 60` operation to extract the minutes, convert it to `INT` type, and assign it to `DT_TO_SDT.MINUTE`.\n    - Use the `tdt / 3600` operation to extract the hours, convert it to `INT` type, and assign it to `DT_TO_SDT.HOUR`.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function ultimately returns a structured data of type `SDT`, containing the following fields:\n  - `YEAR`: The year.\n  - `MONTH`: The month.\n  - `DAY`: The day.\n  - `WEEKDAY`: The day of the week.\n  - `HOUR`: The hour.\n  - `MINUTE`: The minute.\n  - `SECOND`: The second.", "name": "DT_TO_SDT"}

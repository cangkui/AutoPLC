{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple linear interpolation function named `F_LIN2`. It calculates the corresponding `Y` value for a given `X` based on two known points `(X1, Y1)` and `(X2, Y2)`. Linear interpolation is a common mathematical method used to estimate the value of an unknown point between two known points.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables:\n   - `X`: The point for which interpolation is to be calculated.\n   - `X1` and `Y1`: Coordinates of the first known point.\n   - `X2` and `Y2`: Coordinates of the second known point.\n - Output variable:\n   - `F_LIN2`: The function's return value, i.e., the calculated `Y` value based on the linear interpolation formula.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Linear Interpolation Calculation:\n   The core logic of the function is to compute the `Y` value using the linear interpolation formula:\n   \\[\n   Y = \\frac{Y2 - Y1}{X2 - X1} \\times (X - X1) + Y1\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(\\frac{Y2 - Y1}{X2 - X1}\\) is the slope between the two points.\n   - \\((X - X1)\\) is the difference between `X` and the first known point `X1`.\n   - The final result is obtained by multiplying the slope by the difference and then adding the `Y1` value of the first known point.\n   This formula applies when `X1` and `X2` are not equal. If `X1` and `X2` are equal, the formula would result in a division-by-zero error, so it's essential to ensure `X1` and `X2` are not equal in practice.\n\n-- REGION Return Value:\n   After the calculation is complete, the function assigns the result to `F_LIN2`, which serves as the function's return value.\n\n- Summary\n`F_LIN2` is a simple yet highly practical linear interpolation function, suitable for scenarios where intermediate values need to be estimated based on known points. Its implementation is straightforward, but users must ensure `X1` and `X2` are not equal to avoid errors.", "name": "F_LIN2"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `V3_DPRO` to calculate the dot product (inner product) of two three-dimensional vectors (`Vector_3`). The dot product is a fundamental operation in vector arithmetic, commonly used to compute the angle between two vectors or their projections.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `A` and `B`, both of type `Vector_3`. The `Vector_3` structure typically includes three components: `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n  - Output variable: `V3_DPRO`, of type `REAL`, representing the result of the dot product.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute Dot Product\n     The core logic of the function calculates the dot product of the two vectors. The formula for the dot product is:\n     \\[\n     V3\\_DPRO = A.X \\times B.X + A.Y \\times B.Y + A.Z \\times B.Z\n     \\]\n     The specific implementation is as follows:\n     1. Multiply the `X` component of vector `A` with the `X` component of vector `B`.\n     2. Multiply the `Y` component of vector `A` with the `Y` component of vector `B`.\n     3. Multiply the `Z` component of vector `A` with the `Z` component of vector `B`.\n     4. Sum the three products above and assign the result to `V3_DPRO`.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     The final step of the function is to return the value of `V3_DPRO` as the function's output.", "name": "V3_DPRO"}

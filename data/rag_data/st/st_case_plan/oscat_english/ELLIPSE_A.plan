{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `ELLIPSE_A`, is used to calculate the area of an ellipse. It takes two input parameters: `R1` and `R2`, representing the two radii of the ellipse. The function returns a real number, which is the area of the ellipse.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `R1` and `R2`, representing the two radii of the ellipse.\n  - Output variable: `ELLIPSE_A`, representing the area of the ellipse.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate Ellipse Area\n   The logic of the function is very straightforwardâ€”it directly uses the formula for the area of an ellipse. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times R1 \\times R2\n   \\]\n   In the code, this formula is implemented as `math.PI * R1 * R2`, and the result is assigned to `ELLIPSE_A`, which is returned as the function's output.\n\n-- REGION End\n   Once the function logic completes, it directly returns the calculated result.", "name": "ELLIPSE_A"}

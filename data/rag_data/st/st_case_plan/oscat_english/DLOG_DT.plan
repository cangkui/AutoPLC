{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'DLOG_DT', designed to handle log data. It performs different operations based on the input opcode (ADD_COM), including incrementing the log ID, writing column names, writing timestamps, and requesting data additions based on time intervals.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: X, of type DLOG_DATA, used to pass log data.\n - Input Variables: FMT, a string type for timestamp formatting; COLUMN, a string type for specifying column names; DELTA, an unsigned double-word type for defining time intervals.\n - Internal Variables: UCB, of type UNI_CIRCULAR_BUFFER, for handling circular buffer operations; id, a word type for storing the log ID; delta_last, of type DT, for storing the last timestamp.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION CASE x.ADD_COM\n   This region executes different operations based on the value of x.ADD_COM, which is an opcode specifying the current action.\n   - 01:\n        This opcode increments the log ID. First, it increases X.ID_MAX by 1, then sets id to 0x0D01.\n   - 02:\n        This opcode writes the column name. It assigns the value of COLUMN to X.UCB.D_STRING, sets id to X.UCB.D_HEAD, sets X.UCB.D_MODE to 1, and then calls the UCB function block to process the data.\n   - 03:\n        This opcode writes the timestamp. It uses the OSCAT_BASIC.DT_TO_STRF function to convert X.DTI into a formatted string and assigns the result to X.UCB.D_STRING. Then, it sets id to X.UCB.D_HEAD, sets X.UCB.D_MODE to 1, and calls the UCB function block to process the data. Finally, it assigns the value of X.DTI to delta_last.\n   - 04:\n        This opcode requests data addition based on the time interval. First, it checks if DELTA is not zero. If not, it checks whether the current timestamp X.DTI is greater than or equal to delta_last plus DELTA. If true, it sets X.ADD_DATA_REQ to TRUE and assigns the value of X.DTI to delta_last.", "name": "DLOG_DT"}

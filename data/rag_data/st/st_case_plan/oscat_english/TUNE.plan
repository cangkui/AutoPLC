{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a functional block named 'TUNE' for adjusting the output value `Y`. It processes input signals (such as `SET`, `SU`, `SD`, `RST`, etc.) to control changes in `Y` and achieves smooth adjustment based on time parameters (`T1`, `T2`) and step values (`SS`, `S1`, `S2`). The output value `Y` is constrained between `LIMIT_L` and `LIMIT_H`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `SET`, `SU`, `SD`, `RST` for control logic; `SS`, `Limit_L`, `LIMIT_H`, `RST_val`, `SET_val`, `T1`, `T2`, `S1`, `S2` for configuring adjustment behavior.\n - Output variable: `Y` represents the adjusted output value.\n - Internal variables: `tx` records the current time; `start`, `start2` record event start times; `state` indicates the current state; `in` temporarily stores input signals; `step`, `SPEED`, `Y_start`, `Y_start2` are used to calculate changes in `Y`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization and Reset\n   - If `RST` is true, set `Y` to `RST_val` and reset the `state` to 0.\n   - If `SET` is true, set `Y` to `SET_val` and reset the `state` to 0.\n\n-- REGION State Handling\n   - If `state` is greater than 0, it indicates the current adjustment state:\n     - If `state` is 1, `in` takes the value of `SU`; if `state` is 2, `in` takes the value of `SD`.\n     - If `in` is false and the current time minus `start` is less than or equal to `T1`, increment `Y` by `step` and reset `state` to 0.\n     - If `in` is true and the current time minus `start` is greater than or equal to `T2`, calculate a new value for `Y` based on `S2` and `SPEED`.\n     - If `in` is true and the current time minus `start` is greater than or equal to `T1`, calculate a new value for `Y` based on `S1` and `SPEED`, then update `start2` and `Y_start2`.\n     - If `in` is false, reset `state` to 0.\n\n-- REGION Starting Adjustment\n   - If `SU` is true, set `state` to 1, record the current time in `start`, and initialize `step`, `SPEED`, and `Y_start`.\n   - If `SD` is true, set `state` to 2, record the current time in `start`, and initialize `step`, `SPEED`, and `Y_start`.\n\n-- REGION Output Limitation\n   - Finally, use the `LIMIT` function to constrain `Y` between `LIMIT_L` and `LIMIT_H`.\n\n- Summary\nThis functional block implements smooth adjustment of the output value `Y` through a state machine, supporting manual setting, resetting, incrementing, and decrementing operations while ensuring the output remains within the specified range. Time parameters and step values allow flexible configuration of adjustment behavior.", "name": "TUNE"}

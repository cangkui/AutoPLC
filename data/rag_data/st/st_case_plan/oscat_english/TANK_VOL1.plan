Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `TANK_VOL1` is used to calculate the liquid volume in a cylindrical container (such as a storage tank). The function computes the liquid volume by taking input parameters (the container's radius, liquid level height, and container length).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `TR` (container radius), `TL` (container length), `H` (liquid level height).\n  - Output variable: `TANK_VOL1` (the calculated liquid volume).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function involves calling the `OSCAT_BASIC.CIRCLE_SEG` function to calculate the cross-sectional area of the liquid in the cylindrical container, then multiplying it by the container length `TL` to obtain the liquid volume.\n     - `OSCAT_BASIC.CIRCLE_SEG(TR, H)`: This function calculates the liquid area of a circular cross-section. It requires two parameters: the container radius `TR` and the liquid level height `H`.\n     - `TANK_VOL1 := OSCAT_BASIC.CIRCLE_SEG(TR, H) * TL`: The calculated liquid cross-sectional area is multiplied by the container length `TL` to get the liquid volume, and the result is assigned to the output variable `TANK_VOL1`.", "name": "TANK_VOL1"}

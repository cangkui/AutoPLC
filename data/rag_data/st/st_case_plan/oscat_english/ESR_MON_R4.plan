{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named 'ESR_MON_R4' designed to monitor changes in four real-number input values. When a change exceeding the set threshold is detected, the function block records the change information into an output array and sets a flag.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: Four real-number inputs (R0, R1, R2, R3), a date-time input (DT_in), four string addresses (a0, a1, a2, a3), and four real-number thresholds (s0, s1, s2, s3).\n - Output variable: A Boolean flag (ESR_Flag) indicating whether any change has occurred.\n - Input-output variable: An array (ESR_Out) for storing detected change information.\n - Internal variables: Four pointers (p0, p1, p2, p3) pointing to the addresses of the input values; four real numbers (x0, x1, x2, x3) storing the previous input values; a time variable (tx) recording the current time; and an integer (cnt) counting the number of detected changes.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, the current time is converted to the TIME type and stored in the tx variable. Then, the ADR function retrieves the addresses of the four real-number input values and stores them in the pointers p0, p1, p2, p3. Next, ESR_Flag is initialized to FALSE, indicating no changes have occurred. Simultaneously, the type field in the ESR_Out array is initialized to 0, and the cnt counter is initialized to 0.\n-- REGION Change Detection\n   Subsequently, the code checks whether each of the four real-number inputs (R0, R1, R2, R3) has changed significantly compared to their previous values (x0, x1, x2, x3) using the DIFFER function. The criteria for significant change is whether the difference exceeds the corresponding thresholds (s0, s1, s2, s3). If a change is detected, the following actions are taken:\n   - The type field in the ESR_Out array is set to 20, indicating a detected change.\n   - The corresponding string address (a0, a1, a2, a3) is stored in the address field of the ESR_Out array.\n   - The input date-time (DT_in) and current time (tx) are stored in the date-time and timestamp fields of the ESR_Out array.\n   - The Byte_of_Dword function is used to store the four bytes of the input value into the data field of the ESR_Out array.\n   - The previous input values (x0, x1, x2, x3) are updated to the current input values.\n   - The cnt counter is incremented to indicate a detected change.\n   - The ESR_Flag is set to TRUE, indicating that a change has occurred.\n-- REGION End\n   After checking all four input values, the function block completes its execution.", "name": "ESR_MON_R4"}

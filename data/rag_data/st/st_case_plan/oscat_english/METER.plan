{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block, named 'METER', is used to calculate and update an accumulated value (MX) based on input signals and conditions. It computes the accumulated value using the time difference (TC) and input values (M1, M2), and supports a reset function.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: M1, M2 (real input values), I1, I2 (Boolean input signals), D (real, default value 1.0), RST (Boolean, reset signal).\n - Input/output variable: MX (real, accumulated value).\n - Internal variables: MR (real, stores intermediate calculation results), MX1, MX2 (real, stores intermediate values for conditional calculations), tx, last (DWORD, used for time calculations), tc (real, time difference), init (Boolean, initialization flag).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Time Calculation and Initialization\n   - First, get the current time (tx = T_PLC_MS()).\n   - If not initialized (init is FALSE), perform initialization: set last to the current time, assign the value of MX to MR.RX, and initialize MR.R1 to 0.0.\n   - If the current time is the same as the last recorded time (tx = last), return immediately without executing subsequent logic.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the time difference (tc = DWORD_TO_REAL(tx - last) * 0.001), in seconds.\n   - Update last to the current time (last = tx).\n\n-- REGION Reset and Accumulated Value Calculation\n   - If the reset signal RST is TRUE, reset MR.R1 and MR.RX to 0.0.\n   - Otherwise, based on the values of input signals I1 and I2, calculate MX1 and MX2 respectively:\n     - If I1 is TRUE, MX1 = M1; otherwise, MX1 = 0.0.\n     - If I2 is TRUE, MX2 = M2; otherwise, MX2 = 0.0.\n   - Use the R2_ADD function to update the value of MR, with the formula: MR = R2_ADD(MR, (SEL(I1, 0.0, MX1) + SEL(I2, 0.0, MX2)) / D * TC).\n     - The SEL function is used to select MX1 or MX2 based on the values of I1 and I2; if the signal is FALSE, 0.0 is selected.\n     - The final result is divided by D (default value 1.0) and multiplied by the time difference TC to obtain the incremental accumulation for the current cycle.\n   - Assign the value of MR.RX to MX as the output.\n\n-- REGION Output\n   - Finally, the value of MX is updated to MR.RX, serving as the output result of the function block.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block calculates the accumulated value using the time difference and input signals, supporting a reset function. It leverages the time difference (TC) and input values (M1, M2) to compute the incremental value for each cycle, accumulates it into MR, and ultimately outputs MX as the accumulated value.", "name": "METER"}

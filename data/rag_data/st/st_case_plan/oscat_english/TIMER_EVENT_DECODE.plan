{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `TIMER_EVENT_DECODE` designed to decode a timer event string. It parses the input string into a structured timer event and populates the corresponding fields of the structure based on the parsing results.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code includes the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `EVENT` (a string representing the timer event) and `LANG` (an integer representing the language code).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pos`: Tracks the current position while traversing the string.\n    - `start`: Marks the starting position of the current field.\n    - `stop`: Indicates the length of the string.\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the string's byte array for accessing characters.\n    - `step`: Represents the current parsing step (field index).\n    - `tmp`: Temporarily stores parsed field values.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initial Checks\n     The function first verifies whether the input string `EVENT` starts with `<` and ends with `>`. If not, it exits immediately, indicating an invalid string format. If valid, parsing proceeds.\n\n  -- REGION String Parsing\n     A `FOR` loop iterates through each character of the string, starting from the second character (since the first is `<`) until the end. During iteration, it checks for semicolons `;` or closing angle brackets `>`, which signify the end of a field, triggering the field parsing logic.\n\n  -- REGION Field Parsing\n     Based on the value of `step`, different fields are parsed and populated into the `TIMER_EVENT_DECODE` structure:\n    - `step = 0`: Parses `typ` (event type).\n    - `step = 1`: Parses `channel` (channel).\n    - `step = 2`: Parses `day` (date or day of the week). If the field is a hexadecimal digit, it's directly converted to a byte; otherwise, it's interpreted as a day of the week or workday depending on `typ`.\n    - `step = 3`: Parses `start` (start time).\n    - `step = 4`: Parses `duration` (duration).\n    - `step = 5`: Parses `land` (language).\n    - `step = 6`: Parses `LOR` (logical OR relation).\n     After each field is parsed, `start` is updated to the next field's starting position, and `step` increments to proceed to the next field.\n\n  -- REGION Completion\n     Once the loop concludes, the function returns the fully populated `TIMER_EVENT_DECODE` structure.", "name": "TIMER_EVENT_DECODE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a functional block named `STORE_8`, designed to store and update 8 boolean values (`D0` to `D7`). It supports Set (`Set`), Clear (`Clr`), and Reset (`Rst`) operations, with the results output to `Q0` to `Q7`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `Set` (set signal), `D0` to `D7` (data inputs), `Clr` (clear signal), `Rst` (reset signal).\n - Output variables: `Q0` to `Q7` (stored output values).\n - Internal variable: `edge` (used to detect the rising edge of the `Clr` signal).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Reset and Set Logic\n   If the `Rst` or `Set` signal is true, perform the reset or set operation:\n   - When `Rst` is true, all outputs `Q0` to `Q7` are set to false.\n   - When `Set` is true, all outputs `Q0` to `Q7` are set to the value of `D0` (i.e., `Q0` equals `D0`, and other outputs follow `Q0`).\n   This logic ensures that all output values are uniformly initialized when a reset or set signal is triggered.\n\n-- REGION Data Storage Logic\n   If both `Rst` and `Set` signals are false, update the outputs `Q0` to `Q7` based on the input values `D0` to `D7`:\n   - If `D0` is true, `Q0` is set to true.\n   - If `D1` is true, `Q1` is set to true.\n   - This continues similarly until `D7` is true, setting `Q7` to true.\n   This logic ensures that, in the absence of reset or set signals, the output values are updated according to the input values.\n\n-- REGION Clear Logic\n   If the `Clr` signal is true and a rising edge of `Clr` is detected (via the `edge` variable), clear one output value:\n   - Starting from `Q0`, if an output is true, it is set to false.\n   - If `Q0` is false, check `Q1`, and so on, until `Q7`.\n   - The `edge` variable records the current state of `Clr` to detect the rising edge.\n   This logic ensures that, when the clear signal is triggered, output values are cleared one by one until all outputs are false.\n\n-- REGION Update Clear Signal State\n   After executing the clear logic, update the `edge` variable to the current state of `Clr` to detect the rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\nThe `STORE_8` functional block implements the storage and updating of 8 boolean values through straightforward logic. It supports reset, set, and clear operations, dynamically updating output values based on inputs. The clear logic detects the rising edge of `Clr` to clear outputs one by one, ensuring operational precision.", "name": "STORE_8"}

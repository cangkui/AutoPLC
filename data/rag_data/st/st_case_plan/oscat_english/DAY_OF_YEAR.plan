{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `DAY_OF_YEAR` and is used to calculate the day of the year for a given date. It takes a date as input and returns an integer representing the day number within the year.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one input variable:\n  - `IDATE`: The input date, of type `DATE`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    1. **Date Conversion**: First, the input date `IDATE` is converted to an unsigned double integer (`UDINT`) type. In Siemens PLC, the `DATE` type typically represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. Therefore, `DATE_TO_UDINT(IDATE)` converts the date to seconds.\n    2. **Day Calculation**: The converted seconds are divided by `86400` (the number of seconds in a day) to obtain the number of days since January 1, 1970. Then, the `MOD 1461` operation is applied to limit this day count within a 4-year cycle (1461 days), accounting for leap years.\n    3. **Day Adjustment**: Based on the calculated day count, the following adjustments are made:\n       - If the day count is greater than 729 (2 years + 1 day), further checks are performed:\n         - If the day count is greater than 1095 (3 years), subtract 1095.\n         - Otherwise, subtract 729.\n       - If the day count is greater than 364 (1 year), subtract 364.\n       - Otherwise, add 1 to the day count.\n    4. **Return Result**: Finally, the adjusted day count is returned as the function's output.\n\n  The core of this logic handles the differences between leap and non-leap years to ensure the result accurately reflects the actual day of the year for the given date.", "name": "DAY_OF_YEAR"}

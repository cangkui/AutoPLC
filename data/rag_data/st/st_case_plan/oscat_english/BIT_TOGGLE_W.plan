Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `BIT_TOGGLE_W`, is designed to toggle a specified bit in an input `WORD` type data (i.e., changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). The function takes a `WORD` type input and a specified bit position, and outputs the `WORD` type data with the specified bit toggled.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` is a `WORD` type data representing the input binary number; `POS` is an `INT` type value indicating the position of the bit to be toggled.\n - Output variable: `BIT_TOGGLE_W` is a `WORD` type data representing the result after toggling the specified bit.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function uses bitwise operations to toggle the specified bit:\n 1. The `SHL` function is used to left-shift `WORD#1` by `POS` bits, generating a mask with only the specified bit set to 1.\n 2. The `XOR` operator is used to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the generated mask and the input data `IN`. The property of the `XOR` operation is: if two bits are the same, the result is 0; if they are different, the result is 1. Thus, the specified bit is toggled while all other bits remain unchanged.\n 3. The result is assigned to `BIT_TOGGLE_W` as the function's output.\n\n- Example\nAssume the input `IN` is `WORD#16#000F` (binary `0000 0000 0000 1111`) and `POS` is `4`:\n 1. `SHL(WORD#1, 4)` results in `WORD#16#0010` (binary `0000 0000 0001 0000`).\n 2. `WORD#16#0010 XOR WORD#16#000F` results in `WORD#16#001F` (binary `0000 0000 0001 1111`).\n 3. The output `BIT_TOGGLE_W` is `WORD#16#001F`, indicating that the 4th bit has been successfully toggled.\n\nThis function is suitable for scenarios where quick toggling of a specific bit in `WORD` type data is required.", "name": "BIT_TOGGLE_W"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is an extended timer function block (TIMER_EXT) designed to control output signals based on various conditions such as time, sunrise/sunset, holidays, etc. It combines manual control, debounce logic, and time-based condition checks, making it suitable for complex timing control scenarios.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Enable, Start, Stop, Manual Control, Switch, Date/Time Input, Sunrise Time, Sunset Time, Holiday Flag, Debounce Time, Sunrise Start Time, Sunrise Stop Time, Sunset Start Time, Sunset Stop Time, Daily Start Time, Daily Stop Time, Enable Saturday, Enable Sunday, Enable Holidays.\n  - Output variables: Output Signal, Status.\n  - Internal variables: Manual Control Module, Debounce Module, Current Time, Day of the Week, Time Difference, Timestamp, Last Timestamp, Temporary Output, Initialization Flag.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, convert sunrise and sunset times to millisecond precision. Then, fetch the current timestamp and perform initialization. If not initialized, set the last timestamp to the current timestamp and calculate the time difference. If the time difference is less than 200ms, return immediately to avoid frequent processing.\n\n  -- REGION Debounce Processing\n     Use the debounce module to process the switch input, ensuring signal stability. The debounce time is controlled by the input parameter `T_DEBOUNCE`.\n\n  -- REGION Time and Date Processing\n     Convert the input date/time into a time format and determine the current day of the week.\n\n  -- REGION Condition Checks and Output Control\n     Based on the debounce module output, holiday flag, day of the week, daily start/stop times, sunrise/sunset times, and other conditions, determine whether to output a signal. The specific logic is as follows:\n     - If the debounce module output is true, toggle the temporary output and set the status to 110.\n     - If the holiday flag is true and holidays are not enabled, set the temporary output to false.\n     - If the current day is Saturday and Saturday is not enabled, set the temporary output to false.\n     - If the current day is Sunday and Sunday is not enabled, set the temporary output to false.\n     - If the daily start time is later than 00:00 and the current time minus the daily start time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to true and the status to 111.\n     - If the daily stop time is later than 00:00 and the current time minus the daily stop time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to false and the status to 112.\n     - If the sunrise start time is greater than 0 seconds and the current time minus sunrise time plus sunrise start time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to true and the status to 113.\n     - If the sunrise stop time is greater than 0 seconds and the current time minus sunrise time minus sunrise stop time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to false and the status to 114.\n     - If the sunset start time is greater than 0 seconds and the current time minus sunset time plus sunset start time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to true and the status to 115.\n     - If the sunset stop time is greater than 0 seconds and the current time minus sunset time minus sunset stop time is less than or equal to the time difference, set the temporary output to false and the status to 116.\n\n  -- REGION Manual Control\n     Use the manual control module to process the temporary output. The manual control module's inputs include Enable, Start, Stop, and Manual Control signals. The final output signal is determined by the manual control module.\n\n  -- REGION Status Update\n     If the manual control module's status is greater than 100, assign its status value to the output status.", "name": "TIMER_EXT"}

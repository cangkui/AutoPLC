It generates an output value `Y` that changes over time according to input time points and their corresponding values. The function block also supports a scaling factor `K` and an offset `O`, and can monitor the running status and elapsed time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: Scaling factor `K`, offset `O`, time scaling factor `M`, enable signal `E`, initial value `value_0`, and multiple time points with their corresponding values (e.g., `time_1` and `value_1`).\n - Output variables: Current output value `Y`, running status `RUN`, elapsed time `ET`.\n - Internal variables: Current time `tx`, rising edge detection of the enable signal `edge`, state machine state `state`, time points `ta` and `tb`, initial time `t0`, temporary value `temp`, current segment start value `va`, and end value `vb`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization and Enable Detection\n   - First, the current time `tx` is obtained and converted to the `TIME` type. This is done by calling the `T_PLC_MS()` function to get the current milliseconds and then converting it to `TIME` using `DWORD_TO_TIME`.\n   - If the enable signal `E` is true and a rising edge is detected (i.e., `E` changes from false to true), the function block is initialized:\n     - Set the running status `RUN` to true, indicating the function block has started.\n     - Reset the elapsed time `ET` to 0, indicating the timer has started.\n     - Record the initial time `t0` and current time `ta` for subsequent elapsed time calculations.\n     - Calculate the length of the first time segment `tb` using the `multime` function to multiply the input time `time_1` by the scaling factor `M`.\n     - Set the current segment start value `va` to `value_0` and end value `vb` to `value_1`.\n     - Set the temporary value `temp` to the initial value `value_0`, which is the initial value of the output `Y`.\n     - Set the state machine state `state` to 1, indicating entry into the first time segment.\n   - Update the rising edge detection `edge` of the enable signal for detecting the next rising edge of `E` in the next cycle.\n\n-- REGION State Machine and Value Calculation\n   - If the function block is running (`RUN` is true), execute the corresponding logic based on the current state `state`:\n     - **State 1**:\n       - Check if the current time `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the first segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`, indicating entry into the next segment.\n       - Calculate the length of the next segment `tb` using `multime` to multiply `time_2 - time_1` by `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_1` and `vb` to `value_2`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_1`.\n       - Set `state` to 2, indicating entry into the second segment.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation: `temp = ((vb - va) * TIME_TO_REAL(tx - ta) / TIME_TO_REAL(tb) + va)`.\n     - **State 2**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the second segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`.\n       - Calculate `tb` for the next segment using `multime` on `time_3 - time_2` and `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_2` and `vb` to `value_3`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_2`.\n       - Set `state` to 3, indicating entry into the third segment.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n     - **State 3**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the third segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`.\n       - Calculate `tb` for the next segment using `multime` on `time_10 - time_3` and `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_3` and `vb` to `value_10`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_3`.\n       - Set `state` to 4, indicating entry into the fourth segment.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n     - **State 4**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the fourth segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`.\n       - Calculate `tb` for the next segment using `multime` on `time_11 - time_10` and `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_10` and `vb` to `value_11`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_10`.\n       - Depending on `E`, transition to state 5 (if `E` is true) or state 6 (if `E` is false).\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n     - **State 5**:\n       - If `E` is true, update `ta` to `tx`, pausing the timer.\n       - If `E` is false, set `state` to 6 to continue running.\n     - **State 6**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the fifth segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`.\n       - Calculate `tb` for the next segment using `multime` on `time_12 - time_11` and `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_11` and `vb` to `value_12`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_11`.\n       - Set `state` to 7, indicating entry into the sixth segment.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n     - **State 7**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the sixth segment.\n       - If exceeded, update `ta` to `ta + tb`.\n       - Calculate `tb` for the next segment using `multime` on `time_13 - time_12` and `M`.\n       - Update `va` to `value_12` and `vb` to `value_13`.\n       - Set `temp` to `value_12`.\n       - Set `state` to 8, indicating entry into the final segment.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n     - **State 8**:\n       - Check if `tx` exceeds the end time `tb` of the final segment.\n       - If exceeded, set `temp` to `value_13`, indicating curve generation is complete.\n       - Set `RUN` to false, stopping the function block.\n       - If not exceeded, calculate `temp` using linear interpolation.\n   - Finally, multiply `temp` by `K` and add `O` to get the output `Y`, and update `ET` to `tx - t0`.", "name": "FT_Profile"}

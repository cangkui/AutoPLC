Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `V3_SUB` that calculates the difference between two three-dimensional vectors (of type `Vector_3`). The function takes two 3D vectors `A` and `B` as input and outputs their component-wise difference, which is also a vector of type `Vector_3`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n   - Input variables: `A` and `B`, both of type `Vector_3`, representing the two 3D vectors.\n   - Output variable: `V3_SUB`, a vector of type `Vector_3` that stores the computation result.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Vector Difference Calculation\n     This region implements the difference calculation between two 3D vectors. The specific logic is as follows:\n     - Calculate the difference in the `X` component: `V3_SUB.X := A.X - B.X;`\n     - Calculate the difference in the `Y` component: `V3_SUB.Y := A.Y - B.Y;`\n     - Calculate the difference in the `Z` component: `V3_SUB.Z := A.Z - B.Z;`\n     Ultimately, each component of `V3_SUB` stores the difference between the corresponding components of `A` and `B`.\n\n  After the function executes, the returned result is a new 3D vector `V3_SUB`, whose components are the differences between the corresponding components of the input vectors `A` and `B`.", "name": "V3_SUB"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `V3_ZANG`, which calculates the Z-axis angle (i.e., the angle between the vector and the Z-axis) for a 3D vector `A`. The function returns a real number representing the angle in radians.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `A`, of type `Vector_3`, representing a 3D vector.\n  - Local variable: `la`, of type `REAL`, used to store the magnitude (length) of the vector.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculate Vector Magnitude\n     First, the `V3_ABS` function is called to compute the magnitude of the input vector `A`, and the result is stored in the local variable `la`. The `V3_ABS` function calculates the Euclidean norm (i.e., the length) of the vector.\n\n  -- REGION: Calculate Z-Axis Angle\n     Next, the code checks whether the vector magnitude `la` is greater than 0.0. If the magnitude is 0, the vector is a zero vector, and no angle can be calculated, so no operation is performed. If the magnitude is greater than 0.0, the `ACOS` function is used to compute the arccosine of the ratio between the Z-component of vector `A` and the vector magnitude (i.e., `A.Z / la`). The `ACOS` function returns the angle between the vector and the Z-axis in radians. Finally, the calculated angle is assigned to the function's return value `V3_ZANG`.\n\n- Output\n  The return value `V3_ZANG` is the angle between the input vector `A` and the Z-axis, measured in radians. If the input vector is a zero vector, the function does not return any value (i.e., it defaults to returning 0.0).", "name": "V3_ZANG"}

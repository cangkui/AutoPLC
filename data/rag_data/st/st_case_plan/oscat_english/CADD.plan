Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `CADD` for calculating the sum of two complex numbers. The sum of complex numbers is obtained by separately adding the real and imaginary parts of the two numbers.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of which are of type `complex`, representing the two complex numbers.\n  - Output variable: `CADD`, also a `complex` type variable, representing the sum of the two complex numbers.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The main logic of this function is very straightforward. It directly performs addition on the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and assigns the results to the output variable `CADD`.\n     - `CADD.re := X.re + Y.re;`: Adds the real parts of input variables `X` and `Y` and assigns the result to the real part of `CADD`.\n     - `CADD.im := X.im + Y.im;`: Adds the imaginary parts of input variables `X` and `Y` and assigns the result to the imaginary part of `CADD`.", "name": "CADD"}

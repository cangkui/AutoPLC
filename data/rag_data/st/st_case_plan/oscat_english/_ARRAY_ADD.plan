{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function is named `_ARRAY_ADD`, and its purpose is to add a real number `X` to each element of a real-number array. The array is passed via a pointer, and only the first quarter of its elements are processed.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to an array containing up to 32,000 real-number elements.\n    - `size`: The actual size of the array.\n    - `X`: The real number to be added to each element of the array.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `i`: An index variable used for looping.\n    - `stop`: The loop termination condition, calculated as one-fourth of the array size minus one.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. Calculate the loop termination condition `stop`:\n       - Use `SHR(size, 2)` to right-shift `size` by two bits, equivalent to dividing `size` by 4.\n       - Subtract 1 to ensure the loop index does not exceed the first quarter of the array.\n    2. Use a `FOR` loop to iterate through the first quarter of the array elements:\n       - In each iteration, add `X` to the current array element `PT^[i]`.\n    3. The function returns `TRUE` to indicate successful completion.\n\n  The design intent of this function is to efficiently process a portion of the array (the first quarter) rather than the entire array. This may be useful in specific optimization scenarios, but itâ€™s important to note that it does not process all elements of the array.", "name": "_ARRAY_ADD"}

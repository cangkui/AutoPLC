{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `CAUCHYCD`, is used to compute a function value based on the Cauchy distribution. The output is a real number representing the computed result given the input parameters `X`, `T`, and `U`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X`, `T`, and `U`, all of real type, representing the input value, offset, and scaling factor in the function computation, respectively.\n  - Output variable: `CAUCHYCD`, of real type, representing the computed result of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The function's logic is very straightforward, directly computing the result through a mathematical expression. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Compute `(X - T) / U`, which is the core part of the Cauchy distribution, representing the standardized value of input `X` relative to the offset `T`.\n    2. Use the `ATAN` function to compute the arctangent of the previous result, yielding an angle between `-π/2` and `π/2`.\n    3. Multiply the arctangent value by `math.PI_INV` (i.e., `1/π`) to convert it into a value between `-0.5` and `0.5`.\n    4. Finally, add `0.5` to transform the result into a value between `0` and `1`, which serves as the final output `CAUCHYCD`.\n\n    The core idea of this function is to map the input value `X` to a range of `[0, 1]` using the properties of the Cauchy distribution, typically used to represent a certain probability or normalized value.", "name": "CAUCHYCD"}

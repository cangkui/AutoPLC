{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `DEG_TO_DIR`, and its purpose is to convert an input angle value (in degrees) into a directional string. The function determines the output direction by calculating the input degree value, another integer `N`, and a length `L`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `DEG` (degrees), `N` (another integer), `L` (length).\n  - Local variable: `ly` (used to store the language index).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, the function checks if the input length `L` is 0. If `L` is 0, the local variable `ly` is set to the default language index (`LANGUAGE.DEFAULT`). Otherwise, `ly` is set to the smaller value between `L` and the maximum language index (`LANGUAGE.LMAX`). This ensures `ly` stays within the valid range of language indices.\n\n  -- REGION Calculating Direction Index\n     Next, the function calculates the direction index through the following steps:\n     1. Left-shift the input degree value `DEG` by `N-1` bits (`SHL(DEG, N-1)`), then add 45.\n     2. Divide the result by 90 to obtain a temporary value.\n     3. Take the modulo of the temporary value with the result of left-shifting `2^N` by `N` bits (`SHL(INT#2, N)`).\n     4. Right-shift the modulo result by `N` bits (`SHR(INT#8, N)`) to get the final direction index.\n\n  -- REGION Output Direction String\n     Finally, the function accesses the `LANGUAGE.DIRS` array using `ly` and the calculated direction index to retrieve and return the corresponding directional string.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this function involves performing a series of bitwise operations and mathematical calculations on the input angle value to ultimately select and return a directional string from a predefined language direction array. The function's output depends on the values of the input parameters `DEG`, `N`, and `L`, as well as the contents of the language array `LANGUAGE.DIRS`.", "name": "DEG_TO_DIR"}

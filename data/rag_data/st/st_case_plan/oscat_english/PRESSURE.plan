  "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `PRESSURE`, designed to convert input pressure units into multiple different output pressure units. It accepts several input pressure values and calculates/outputs corresponding converted results based on these inputs.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `mws`, `torr`, `att`, `atm`, `pa`, `bar`, representing pressure values in different units (e.g., milliwatt-seconds, torr, atmospheres, pascals, bars, etc.).\n  - Output variables: `Ymws`, `Ytorr`, `Yatt`, `Yatm`, `Ypa`, `Ybar`, representing the converted pressure values in units such as milliwatt-seconds, torr, atmospheres, pascals, bars, etc.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Pressure Conversion Logic\n     This region implements the pressure unit conversion logic. First, it calculates the value of `Ybar`, which is derived by summing the input unit `bar` with other input units (`pa`, `att`, `atm`, `torr`, `mws`) multiplied by specific conversion coefficients. The formula is:\n    ```\n    Ybar := bar + pa * 1.0E-5 + 0.980665 * att + 1.01325 * atm + 0.001333224 * torr + 0.0980665 * mws;\n    ```\n     Next, based on the value of `Ybar`, it calculates the pressure values for other output units:\n    - `Ymws`: Obtained by multiplying `Ybar` by the conversion coefficient `10.1971621297793`.\n    - `Ytorr`: Obtained by multiplying `Ybar` by the conversion coefficient `750.0615050434140`.\n    - `Yatt`: Obtained by multiplying `Ybar` by the conversion coefficient `1.0197162129779`.\n    - `Yatm`: Obtained by multiplying `Ybar` by the conversion coefficient `0.9869232667160`.\n    - `Ypa`: Obtained by multiplying `Ybar` by the conversion coefficient `100000.0`.\n\n     These calculations convert the input pressure values into multiple commonly used pressure units, making it convenient for users to select the desired unit for their needs.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block achieves pressure unit conversions through straightforward mathematical operations. Both inputs and outputs are of the `REAL` type, making it suitable for applications requiring the handling of multiple pressure units.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block `A_TRIG`, designed to detect whether the change in the input signal `IN` exceeds a given threshold `RES`. If the change surpasses the threshold, the output `Q` is set to `TRUE`, and the output `D` displays the difference between the current input and the previous input. This function block is typically used to detect rising or falling edges of a signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` represents the current input signal, and `RES` represents the detection threshold.\n  - Output variables: `Q` indicates whether a change has been detected, and `D` shows the difference between the current and previous input.\n  - Internal variable: `last_in` stores the previous input value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    1. **Calculate Difference**: First, compute the difference between the current input `IN` and the previous input `last_in`, then assign the result to `D`.\n    2. **Detect Change**: Determine if the absolute value of the difference exceeds the threshold `RES`. If it does, set the output `Q` to `TRUE`, indicating a detected change; otherwise, `Q` remains `FALSE`.\n    3. **Update Previous Input**: If a change is detected (i.e., `Q` is `TRUE`), store the current input `IN` value into `last_in` for use in the next cycle.\n    4. **Recalculate Difference**: To ensure `D` reflects the latest value, recalculate the difference between `IN` and `last_in` and update `D`.\n\n  The logic of this function block is straightforward, primarily used to detect changes in the input signal and trigger an output when the change exceeds the threshold. By utilizing the `last_in` variable, the function block remembers the previous input value, enabling effective change detection.", "name": "A_TRIG"}

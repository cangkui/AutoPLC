{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a simple rising-edge detection function block named 'B_TRIG'. It detects the rising edge of an input signal (CLK) and outputs a pulse signal (Q) when a rising edge is detected.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: CLK (input signal).\n  - Output variable: Q (output signal, indicating whether a rising edge is detected).\n  - Local variable: edge (stores the CLK state from the previous cycle).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function block is very simple and consists of two steps:\n    1. **Output Calculation**: The current input signal (CLK) is compared with the input signal from the previous cycle (edge) using an XOR operation. If they differ, it means a state change has occurred, and Q is set to TRUE (indicating a rising edge is detected); otherwise, Q remains FALSE.\n    2. **State Update**: The current input signal (CLK) is stored in the local variable (edge) for comparison in the next cycle.\n\n    This design allows the function block to detect the rising edge of the input signal (a change from FALSE to TRUE) and output a pulse signal (Q as TRUE) when the rising edge occurs.\n\n    For example:\n    - If CLK changes from FALSE to TRUE, Q will output TRUE.\n    - If CLK remains TRUE or FALSE without change, Q will output FALSE.\n    - If CLK changes from TRUE to FALSE, Q will still output FALSE (since this is not a rising edge).\n\n    This type of function block is commonly used in scenarios where signal changes need to be detected, such as triggering certain operations or events.", "name": "B_TRIG"}

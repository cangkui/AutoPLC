{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `_BUFFER_INIT`, is used to initialize a memory buffer. It sets each byte in the buffer to a specified initialization value. The function employs pointer operations and loops to achieve efficient buffer initialization.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `PT`: A pointer to the buffer, of type `POINTER TO BYTE`.\n    - `SIZE`: The size of the buffer, of type `UINT`.\n    - `INIT`: The byte value used to initialize the buffer, of type `BYTE`.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `ptw`: A pointer to the buffer, of type `POINTER TO DWORD`, used for handling 32-bit aligned portions.\n    - `temp`: A temporary variable used to store the current pointer value and calculate aligned addresses, of type `DWORD`.\n    - `end`: The end address of the buffer, of type `DWORD`.\n    - `end32`: The end address of the 32-bit aligned portion of the buffer, of type `DWORD`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- Buffer Initialization:\n    1. First, set `temp` to the starting address of the buffer (`PT`) and calculate the end address of the buffer (`end`).\n    2. Compute the end address of the 32-bit aligned portion of the buffer (`end32`), which is `end - 3`.\n    3. Use a `WHILE` loop to handle the non-aligned portion of the buffer (when the pointer address is not aligned to a 4-byte boundary):\n       - Set the byte at the current pointer location to the `INIT` value.\n       - Increment the pointer and `temp` variable until the pointer address is aligned to a 4-byte boundary or reaches the end of the buffer.\n    4. Convert the pointer to type `POINTER TO DWORD` (`ptw`) to handle the 32-bit aligned portion.\n    5. Extend the `INIT` value to 32 bits (by repeating the `INIT` value four times) and store it in `temp`.\n    6. Use a `WHILE` loop to handle the 32-bit aligned portion of the buffer:\n       - Set the 32-bit value at the current pointer location to `temp`.\n       - Increment the pointer by 4 bytes until it reaches `end32`.\n    7. Convert the pointer back to type `POINTER TO BYTE` (`pt`) to handle the remaining bytes.\n    8. Use a `WHILE` loop to handle the remaining bytes in the buffer:\n       - Set the byte at the current pointer location to the `INIT` value.\n       - Increment the pointer until it reaches `end`.\n    9. The function returns `TRUE`, indicating that the buffer initialization is complete.", "name": "_BUFFER_INIT"}

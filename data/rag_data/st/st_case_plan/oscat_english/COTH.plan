{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `COTH` is used to calculate the hyperbolic cotangent (Hyperbolic Cotangent) of the input value `X`. The hyperbolic cotangent function is a type of hyperbolic function, defined as `COTH(X) = COSH(X) / SINH(X)`, where `COSH` is the hyperbolic cosine function and `SINH` is the hyperbolic sine function. This function implements the calculation of the hyperbolic cotangent through conditional checks and mathematical formulas.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the independent variable of the hyperbolic cotangent function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function handles different ranges of input values through conditional checks:\n     1. If `X > 20.0`, `COTH` is directly set to `1.0`. This is because when the value of `X` is large, the hyperbolic cotangent function approaches `1`, so returning `1.0` directly improves computational efficiency.\n     2. If `X < -20.0`, `COTH` is set to `-1.0`. This is because when `X` is small (negative with a large absolute value), the hyperbolic cotangent function approaches `-1`, so returning `-1.0` directly is appropriate.\n     3. If `X` is between `-20.0` and `20.0`, the formula `COTH := 1.0 + 2.0 / (EXP(X * 2.0) - 1.0)` is used to compute the hyperbolic cotangent value. This formula is the mathematical expression of the hyperbolic cotangent function, where `EXP` is the exponential function.\n\n     This segmented approach ensures both computational accuracy and performance optimization, avoiding complex mathematical operations for extreme values.", "name": "COTH"}

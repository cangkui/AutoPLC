{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'TN_SC_FILL', designed to fill a rectangular area on the screen. The function block updates the specified screen area by defining the start and end coordinates, along with the fill character and attributes.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in_X`, `in_Y`, `in_Offset`, used to track the current coordinates and offset during processing in loops.\n - Internal variables: `Iin_Y1`, `Iin_X1`, `Iin_Y2`, `Iin_X2`, representing the start and end coordinates of the rectangular area; `Iby_CHAR`, `Iby_Attr`, representing the fill character and attributes.\n - Output variable: `Xus_TN_SCREEN`, a structure containing the screen's character and color arrays, as well as flags for rows that need updating.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Input Validation\n  First, the code calls the `TN_SC_XY2_ERROR` function to verify whether the input start and end coordinates are valid. If the coordinates are invalid, the function returns immediately without further execution.\n\n-- REGION Filling the Rectangular Area\n  The code uses two nested `FOR` loops to iterate through the specified rectangular area. The outer loop processes each row, while the inner loop processes each column.\n  - For each row, the code first sets `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_Line_Update[in_Y]` to `TRUE`, indicating that the row requires an update.\n  - Then, it calculates the starting offset `in_Offset` for the current row and begins iterating through each column in that row.\n  - Within the inner loop, the code sets `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_CHAR[in_Offset]` to `Iby_CHAR` (the fill character) and `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_COLOR[in_Offset]` to `Iby_Attr` (the fill attributes).\n  - After processing each character, `in_Offset` is incremented to move to the next character.\n\n-- REGION Completion\n  After processing all rows, the function block concludes.", "name": "TN_SC_FILL"}

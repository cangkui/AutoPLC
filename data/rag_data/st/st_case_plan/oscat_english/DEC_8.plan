{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a functional block named `DEC_8`, which implements a 3-to-8 decoder. Based on a 3-bit binary address input (A0, A1, A2) and an enable signal (D), it selects one of the output signals (Q0 to Q7) and sets it to the value of D.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: D (enable signal), A0, A1, A2 (3-bit binary address).\n  - Output variables: Q0 to Q7 (8 output signals).\n  - Internal variable: X (used to store the combined address value, of type INT).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Address Combination\n    First, the 3-bit binary address inputs (A0, A1, A2) are combined into an integer X. Each bit of X corresponds to A0, A1, and A2, respectively. For example, if A0=1, A1=0, A2=1, then X has the value 5 (binary 101).\n  -- REGION Output Initialization\n    All output signals (Q0 to Q7) are initialized to FALSE, ensuring that all outputs remain low when none are selected.\n  -- REGION Decoding Logic\n    A CASE statement is used to select the corresponding output signal based on the value of X and set it to the value of D. The specific logic is as follows:\n    - If X=0, set Q0 to D.\n    - If X=1, set Q1 to D.\n    - If X=2, set Q2 to D.\n    - If X=3, set Q3 to D.\n    - If X=4, set Q4 to D.\n    - If X=5, set Q5 to D.\n    - If X=6, set Q6 to D.\n    - If X=7, set Q7 to D.\n    This approach achieves the functionality of a 3-to-8 decoder, selecting the appropriate output signal based on the 3-bit input address.\n\n- Summary\nThis functional block implements a simple 3-to-8 decoder, capable of selecting and activating the corresponding output signal based on the 3-bit input address and enable signal. The code logic is clear and easy to understand, making it suitable for scenarios requiring decoding functionality.", "name": "DEC_8"}

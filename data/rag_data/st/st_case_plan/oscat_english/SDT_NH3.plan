{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named 'SDT_NH3' designed to calculate the saturation temperature of NH3 based on the input pressure value. The function employs different formulas depending on the pressure range to determine the saturation temperature.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one input variable:\n  - P: The input pressure value, of type REAL (floating-point number).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Saturation Temperature\n     The core logic of the function involves calculating the NH3 saturation temperature using different formulas based on the input pressure value P. The specific logic is as follows:\n     1. If P is less than 1.0E-3 (i.e., 0.001), the saturation temperature SDT_NH3 is set to -110.0.\n     2. If P is less than 1.0, the formula `506.713 / (3.18757 - LOG(P)) - 192.37` is used to compute the saturation temperature.\n     3. If P is greater than or equal to 1.0, the formula `1113.928 / (4.86886 - LOG(P)) - 262.71` is used to compute the saturation temperature.\n\n     Finally, the function returns the calculated saturation temperature value SDT_NH3.", "name": "SDT_NH3"}

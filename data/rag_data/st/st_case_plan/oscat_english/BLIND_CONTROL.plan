{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function block named 'BLIND_CONTROL' for controlling the position and angle of blinds. It uses input signals (such as up, down, target position, and angle) to control the movement of the blinds and outputs the current position, angle, status, and other information.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: UP (raise signal), DN (lower signal), S_IN (status input), PI (target position), AI (target angle), T_UD (up/down movement time), T_ANGLE (angle adjustment time), SENS (sensitivity), T_LOCKOUT (lockout time).\n  - Output variables: POS (current position), ANG (current angle), MU (motor raise signal), MD (motor lower signal), STATUS (status output).\n  - Internal variables: act (blind actuator instance), delta (position or angle deviation), bTimeTest (time test flag), iPos (internal position), iAngel (internal angle).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Time Test Logic\n     If `bTimeTest` is true, simulate input signals by setting `PI` and `AI` to `iPos` and `iAngel`, respectively, and setting `UP` and `DN` to true for testing purposes.\n  \n  -- REGION Actuator Initialization\n     Call the `act` function block with parameters `T_UD`, `T_ANGLE`, and `T_LOCKOUT` to initialize the blind actuator.\n\n  -- REGION Blind Control Logic\n     If both `UP` and `DN` are true, adjust the blind state based on the target position and angle. The logic is as follows:\n     - If the current position is less than the target position minus the deviation `delta`, activate the raise signal, deactivate the lower signal, reset `delta`, and set the status to 121.\n     - If the current position is greater than the target position plus the deviation `delta`, activate the lower signal, deactivate the raise signal, reset `delta`, and set the status to 122.\n     - If the current angle is less than the target angle minus `delta` and the angle adjustment time exceeds 100ms, activate the raise signal, deactivate the lower signal, set `delta` to half the sensitivity, and set the status to 123.\n     - If the current angle is greater than the target angle plus `delta` and the angle adjustment time exceeds 100ms, activate the lower signal, deactivate the raise signal, set `delta` to half the sensitivity, and set the status to 124.\n     - If none of the above conditions are met, deactivate both raise and lower signals, set `delta` to the sensitivity value, and set the status to the input status `S_IN`.\n     If `UP` and `DN` are not both true, directly pass the `UP` and `DN` signals to the actuator and set the status to the input status `S_IN`.\n\n  -- REGION Actuator Update\n     Call the `act` function block again with updated parameters to ensure actuator state synchronization.\n\n  -- REGION Output Update\n     Output the actuator's current position, angle, motor raise signal, motor lower signal, and status to the function block's output variables.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block compares the current state with the target state to control the raise and lower signals of the blinds and adjust their position and angle. It also supports a time test mode and outputs current status information. The logic uses deviation `delta` and sensitivity `SENS` to optimize control precision.", "name": "BLIND_CONTROL"}

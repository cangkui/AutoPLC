Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block `M_T` that measures the duration of an input signal `IN` and outputs the duration when the input signal goes low. It also supports a reset function and allows setting a maximum measurement time `TMAX`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `TMAX` (maximum measurement time), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `PT` (duration, output when the input signal goes low), `ET` (current duration).\n  - Internal variables: `edge` (used to detect the rising edge of the input signal), `start` (records the time when the input signal goes high), `tx` (current time).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Time Measurement Logic\n      1. First, the current time `tx` is obtained using the `T_PLC_MS()` function, which retrieves the PLC's current time in milliseconds and converts it to the `TIME` type.\n      2. If the reset signal `RST` is true, or if the current duration `ET` exceeds the maximum measurement time `TMAX`, then `PT` and `ET` are reset to `0`.\n      3. If the input signal `IN` is true:\n         - If `edge` is false (indicating a rising edge of the input signal), the current time `tx` is recorded in the `start` variable.\n         - The current duration `ET` is calculated as the difference between the current time `tx` and the start time `start`.\n      4. If the input signal `IN` is false, the current duration `ET` is assigned to `PT`, representing the duration of the input signal.\n      5. Finally, the `edge` variable is updated to the current state of the input signal `IN` to detect the rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block measures the duration of the input signal by detecting its rising and falling edges and outputs the duration when the input signal goes low. The support for a reset signal and maximum measurement time makes this function block more flexible and safer.", "name": "M_T"}

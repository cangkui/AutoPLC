{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `ACTUATOR_UD` for controlling the upward and downward movement of an actuator. It supports both manual and automatic modes and includes timeout and state management logic. The function block determines the actuator's actions based on input signals (such as `UP`, `DN`, `ON`, `UD`, etc.) and reflects the current state through output signals (`Yup`, `Ydn`, `status`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `UD` (up/down control signal), `ON` (enable signal), `Manual` (manual mode), `Up` (up signal), `Dn` (down signal), `off` (shutdown signal), `YUP_in` (up feedback signal), `YDN_in` (down feedback signal), `TON` (on time), `TOFF` (off time), `out_return` (output return signal).\n  - Output variables: `Yup` (up output), `Ydn` (down output), `status` (status code).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `last` (last operation time), `init` (initialization flag).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     When the function block runs for the first time, the `init` variable is `FALSE`. At this point, the current time `tx` is recorded into `last`, and `init` is set to `TRUE`, completing the initialization.\n  \n  -- REGION Shutdown Logic\n     If the `off` signal is `TRUE`, the actuator's actions are immediately stopped, `Yup` and `Ydn` are set to `FALSE`, `last` is updated to the current time, and the status code `status` is set to `101`, indicating the actuator is shut down.\n\n  -- REGION Timeout Logic\n     If `Yup` or `Ydn` is `TRUE` and the difference between the current time and the last operation time is less than `TON` (on time), the function returns without performing any action. Similarly, if both `Yup` and `Ydn` are `FALSE` and the time difference is less than `TOFF` (off time), it also returns directly.\n\n  -- REGION Manual Mode\n     If the `Manual` signal is `TRUE`, manual mode is activated. Here, `status` is set to `102`, indicating manual mode is active.\n     - If `Yup` is `TRUE` and `Up` is `FALSE`, or `Ydn` is `TRUE` and `Dn` is `FALSE`, the actuator's actions are stopped, `Yup` and `Ydn` are set to `FALSE`, and `last` is updated.\n     - If `Up` is `TRUE` and both `Dn` and `off` are `FALSE`, the upward action is initiated: `Yup` is set to `TRUE`, `Ydn` to `FALSE`, `last` is updated, and `status` is set to `103`.\n     - If `Dn` is `TRUE` and both `Up` and `off` are `FALSE`, the downward action is initiated: `Yup` is set to `FALSE`, `Ydn` to `TRUE`, `last` is updated, and `status` is set to `104`.\n     - If none of the above conditions are met, the actuator's actions are stopped, and `last` is updated.\n\n  -- REGION Automatic Mode\n     If the `Manual` signal is `FALSE`, automatic mode is activated.\n     - If `Yup` is `TRUE` and `UD` is `FALSE`, or `Ydn` is `TRUE` and `UD` is `TRUE`, the actuator's actions are stopped, `Yup` and `Ydn` are set to `FALSE`, and `last` is updated.\n     - If `UD` is `TRUE` and both `ON` and `off` are `FALSE`, the upward action is initiated: `Yup` is set to `TRUE`, `Ydn` to `FALSE`, `last` is updated, and `status` is set to `111`.\n     - If `UD` is `FALSE` and both `ON` and `off` are `FALSE`, the downward action is initiated: `Yup` is set to `FALSE`, `Ydn` to `TRUE`, `last` is updated, and `status` is set to `112`.\n     - If none of the above conditions are met, the actuator's actions are stopped, `last` is updated, and `status` is set to `110`.\n\n  -- REGION Feedback Logic\n     If `Ydn` is `TRUE` and both `YUP_in` and `out_return` are `TRUE`, the downward action is stopped: `Ydn` is set to `FALSE`, and `status` is set to `1`. Similarly, if `Yup` is `TRUE` and both `YDN_in` and `out_return` are `TRUE`, the upward action is stopped: `Yup` is set to `FALSE`, and `status` is set to `2`.", "name": "ACTUATOR_UD"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block is named `MINUTE_OF_DT` and is used to extract the minute component from DateTime (DT) type data. It converts the DateTime into a DWORD type, then performs modulo and division operations to extract the minute value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input Variable: `XDT`, of type `DT`, representing the input DateTime data.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Logic Processing:\n   - First, the input `DT` type data `XDT` is converted to `DWORD` type. `DT` is the DateTime type, while `DWORD` is a 32-bit unsigned integer.\n   - Then, the converted `DWORD` value undergoes a modulo operation `MOD 3600`. Since 3600 seconds equals 1 hour, the modulo operation removes the hour component, leaving the remaining seconds.\n   - Next, the result of the modulo operation is divided by 60 to obtain the minute component.\n   - Finally, the result is converted to `INT` type and assigned to the output `MINUTE_OF_DT`.\n\n- Output Result\n   - The output of the function block, `MINUTE_OF_DT`, is the minute component of the input DateTime `XDT`, with type `INT`.\n\nSummary: This function block extracts the minute component from DateTime data through simple mathematical operations, making it suitable for scenarios requiring time data processing.", "name": "MINUTE_OF_DT"}

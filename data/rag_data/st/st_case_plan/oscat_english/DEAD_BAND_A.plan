{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block, named `DEAD_BAND_A`, is designed to implement a signal processing function with a dead zone. A dead zone is a nonlinear control technique used to eliminate minor fluctuations or unwanted noise in input signals. The block processes the input signal using two first-order low-pass filters (`FT_PT1`) and calculates the output signal `Y` and the dead zone width `L`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input Variables**:\n    - `X`: Input signal, of type `REAL`.\n    - `T`: Time constant, of type `TIME`, determining the response time of the low-pass filters.\n    - `KL`: Proportional coefficient for the dead zone width, of type `REAL`, with a default value of `1.0`.\n    - `LM`: Upper limit for the dead zone width, of type `REAL`.\n  - **Output Variables**:\n    - `Y`: Output signal after dead zone processing, of type `REAL`.\n    - `L`: Calculated dead zone width, of type `REAL`.\n  - **Internal Variables**:\n    - `tp1` and `tp2`: Two first-order low-pass filters (`FT_PT1`) used to smooth the input signal and compute the dead zone width.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- **REGION Signal Processing**:\n    1. **Input Signal Filtering**:\n       - The first low-pass filter `tp1` smooths the input signal `X`, with the response time set by the input parameter `T`.\n       - The output is `tp1.out`, representing the smoothed input signal.\n    2. **Dead Zone Width Calculation**:\n       - The second low-pass filter `tp2` computes the absolute difference between the input signal `X` and the smoothed signal `tp1.out`, with a response time of `4 * T`.\n       - The output is `tp2.out`, indicating the amplitude of signal fluctuations.\n       - The dead zone width `L` is calculated using the formula `MIN(KL * tp2.out, LM)`, where `KL` is the proportional coefficient and `LM` is the upper limit for the dead zone width.\n    3. **Dead Zone Processing**:\n       - If the input signal `X` is greater than the dead zone width `L`, the output signal `Y` is set to `X - L`.\n       - If the input signal `X` is less than the negative dead zone width `-L`, the output signal `Y` is set to `X + L`.\n       - If the input signal `X` falls within the dead zone range (i.e., `-L <= X <= L`), the output signal `Y` is set to `0.0`.\n\n- Summary\nThe `DEAD_BAND_A` functional block smooths the input signal using low-pass filters, calculates the dead zone width, and applies nonlinear processing to the input signal based on the dead zone width, outputting the processed signal `Y` and the dead zone width `L`. This block is suitable for applications requiring the elimination of minor signal fluctuations or noise.", "name": "DEAD_BAND_A"}

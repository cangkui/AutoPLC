{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `REFRACTION`, is used to calculate the refraction correction value for a given elevation angle. The refraction correction is commonly applied in astronomy and meteorology to adjust the observed elevation angle of celestial bodies or objects, accounting for atmospheric refraction effects.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `ELEV`, representing the elevation angle (in degrees).\n  - Output variable: `REFRACTION`, representing the calculated refraction correction value (in radians).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Input Validation and Constraints\n     - First, the `LIMIT` function is used to restrict the input elevation angle `ELEV` to a valid range (-1.9 to 80.0 degrees). This prevents invalid inputs (e.g., negative or excessively large values) from causing calculation errors or exceptions.\n  \n  -- REGION Refraction Correction Calculation\n     - The formula for calculating the refraction correction is:\n       ```\n       REFRACTION = (0.0174532925199433) / TAN(0.0174532925199433 * (ELEV + 10.3 / (ELEV + 5.11)))\n       ```\n     - The coefficient `0.0174532925199433` in the formula converts degrees to radians (Ï€/180).\n     - The core part of the formula, `ELEV + 10.3 / (ELEV + 5.11)`, is a correction term for the elevation angle, accounting for atmospheric refraction effects.\n     - The `TAN` function computes the tangent of the corrected elevation angle, and the final result is obtained through division to yield the refraction correction value.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n     - The calculated result `REFRACTION` is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Summary\nThis function limits the input elevation angle to a valid range and applies a specific refraction correction formula to compute the refraction correction value. This value can be used to adjust observed elevation angles, improving the accuracy of astronomical or meteorological observations.", "name": "REFRACTION"}

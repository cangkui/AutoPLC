{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function, named `HOUR_OF_DT`, is designed to extract the hour component from a `DT` (date-time) data type and return it as an integer. The input is a variable of type `DT`, and the output is an integer representing the hour value from the input date-time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one class of variables:\n  - Input variable: `XDT`, of type `DT`, representing the input date-time value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Logic Implementation:\n    1. First, convert the input `DT` variable `XDT` to type `DWORD`. The `DT` type typically represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.\n    2. Then, use the `MOD 86400` operation to extract the seconds part of the current date (since 86,400 seconds equal one day). This step removes the date portion, leaving only the time component.\n    3. Next, divide the seconds part of the time by 3,600 (since 3,600 seconds equal one hour) to obtain the current hour count.\n    4. Finally, convert the result from `DWORD` to `INT` type and return it as the function's output.\n\n  Example:\n  Assume `XDT` has the value `DT#2023-10-05-14:30:45`, representing October 5, 2023, at 14:30:45.\n  - `DT_TO_DWORD(XDT)` converts it to the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (hypothetically `1696516245`).\n  - `1696516245 MOD 86400` yields `52245`, representing the seconds part of the current time.\n  - `52245 / 3600` gives `14`, which is the current hour count.\n  - The function ultimately returns `14`.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns an integer representing the hour part of the input date-time. For example, given `DT#2023-10-05-14:30:45`, the function returns `14`.", "name": "HOUR_OF_DT"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a functional block named `TELNET_LOG`, which is used to send log messages to a remote server via the Telnet protocol. The block reads messages from the log control structure and transmits them to the specified Telnet server. It also supports configuring Telnet options, port numbers, message colors, and more.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `IP_C` (IP connection status), `S_BUF` (network buffer), `LOG_CL` (log control structure)\n - Input Variables: `ENABLE` (enable signal), `OPTION` (Telnet options such as buffer flush, line breaks, colors, etc.), `PORT` (Telnet port number)\n - Output Variables: `READY` (indicates whether the functional block is ready)\n - Internal Variables: `TELNET_PRINT` (instance of the Telnet print function block), `done` (whether sending is complete), `init` (initialization flag), `watchdog` (watchdog timer), `ci` (current log index), `pi` (processing log index), `pi_last` (last processed log index), `send` (send flag)\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   During the first run of the functional block, internal variables are initialized. If `OPTION` is greater than 0, it is assigned to `TELNET_PRINT.OPTION`. If `PORT` is greater than 0, it is assigned to `TELNET_PRINT.PORT`. Additionally, the watchdog timer's preset time is set to 1 millisecond.\n-- REGION Watchdog Timer\n   The watchdog timer monitors the execution time of the functional block. If the block does not complete its operation within the specified time, the watchdog triggers a timeout signal.\n-- REGION Log Index Processing\n   The current log index `ci` is retrieved, and the IP connection status is checked. If the IP connection status is `BYTE#1`, indicating the connection is closed, the processing index `pi` is reset, and the functional block is reinitialized.\n-- REGION Log Sending Loop\n   Log messages are processed via a `REPEAT` loop. If the current processing index `pi` does not match the current log index `ci`, and the IP connection status is greater than `BYTE#127` (indicating the connection is established), log message processing begins. If `pi` is 0 and the log control structure is in ring mode, `pi` is set to `ci`. Then, `pi` is incremented to process the next message. If `pi` exceeds the size of the log control structure, it is reset to 1. The send flag `SEND` is set to true, and the `TELNET_PRINT` function block is called to send the message. If sending is incomplete, the processing index reverts to the last processed index `pi_last`.\n-- REGION Watchdog Monitoring\n   During each loop iteration, the watchdog timer is started. If the watchdog times out or sending is incomplete, the loop exits.\n-- REGION Output\n   The `TELNET_PRINT.READY` signal is assigned to the `READY` output, indicating whether the functional block is ready.\n\n- Summary\nThe `TELNET_LOG` functional block sends log messages to a remote server via the Telnet protocol. It supports configuring Telnet options, port numbers, and message colors, while monitoring operation execution time with a watchdog timer. The core logic involves processing messages from the log control structure in a loop and calling the `TELNET_PRINT` function block to send messages.", "name": "TELNET_LOG"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `MUX_R2`, which selects one of two real-number inputs, `IN0` and `IN1`, as the output based on the value of the Boolean input `A`. The function implements a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) logic.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `IN0`: Type `REAL`, representing the first real-number input.\n    - `IN1`: Type `REAL`, representing the second real-number input.\n    - `A`: Type `BOOL`, representing the selection signal that determines whether the output is `IN0` or `IN1`.\n  - Output variable:\n    - `MUX_R2`: Type `REAL`, representing the output result of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function uses the `SEL` function to implement the 2-to-1 multiplexer. The `SEL` function selects either `IN0` or `IN1` as the output based on the Boolean input `A`:\n    - If `A` is `TRUE`, the output is `IN1`.\n    - If `A` is `FALSE`, the output is `IN0`.\n    The selected result is then assigned to `MUX_R2` as the return value of the function.", "name": "MUX_R2"}

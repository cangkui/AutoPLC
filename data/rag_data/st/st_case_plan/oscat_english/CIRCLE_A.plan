{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `CIRCLE_A` that calculates a value related to a circle. The function takes two input parameters, `rx` and `ax`, and returns a result of type `REAL`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `rx` and `ax`, both of type `REAL`, representing the input values required for the calculation.\n  - Output variable: `circle_A`, of type `REAL`, representing the computed result of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculation Logic\n    The core logic of the function calculates the value of `circle_A` using the formula `circle_A := Rx * RX * 8.726646E-3 * Ax`. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Multiply the input parameters `rx` and `ax`.\n    2. Multiply the result by the constant `8.726646E-3` (a floating-point number in scientific notation, equivalent to 0.008726646).\n    3. Assign the final result to `circle_A` and return it.\n\n    Note: The `Rx` and `RX` in the formula may be a typo and should likely refer to the same variable `rx`. Therefore, the correct formula should be:\n    ```plaintext\n    circle_A := rx * rx * 8.726646E-3 * ax\n    ```\n\n    This formula might be used to calculate a value related to the area or arc length of a circle, but the exact application scenario requires further analysis based on the context.", "name": "CIRCLE_A"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SIGMOID`, which calculates the value of the Sigmoid function. The Sigmoid function is a commonly used activation function whose output ranges between 0 and 1, often applied to binary classification problems in machine learning.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input value of the Sigmoid function, with the type `REAL` (real number).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     This region implements the calculation logic of the Sigmoid function. Depending on the range of the input value `X`, the function returns different values:\n     1. If `X > 20.0`, the function returns `1.0`. This is because when `X` is sufficiently large, the value of the Sigmoid function approaches 1.\n     2. If `X < -85.0`, the function returns `0.0`. This is because when `X` is sufficiently small, the value of the Sigmoid function approaches 0.\n     3. If `X` is between `-85.0` and `20.0`, the function calculates the Sigmoid value using the formula `1.0 / (1.0 + EXP(-X))`. Here, `EXP(-X)` represents the natural exponential function `e` raised to the power of `-X`.\n     Finally, the function returns the computed Sigmoid value.", "name": "SIGMOID"}

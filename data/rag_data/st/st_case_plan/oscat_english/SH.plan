{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block is named 'SH' and is used to pass the input value to the output and generate a trigger signal when a rising edge of the input signal is detected. It is primarily used to detect the rising edge of a Boolean signal and execute corresponding operations upon detection.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in` (real type, for input value), `CLK` (Boolean type, for detecting the rising edge of the clock signal).\n - Output variables: `out` (real type, for output value), `trig` (Boolean type, indicating whether a rising edge is detected).\n - Internal variables: `edge` (Boolean type, used to store the previous cycle's `CLK` state for edge detection).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   This region implements the core logic of the functional block. First, it checks whether the `CLK` signal is true and the `edge` signal is false to detect the rising edge of the `CLK` signal. If a rising edge is detected, the input value `in` is assigned to the output value `out`, and the trigger signal `trig` is set to true. Otherwise, the trigger signal `trig` is set to false. Finally, the current state of the `CLK` signal is stored in the `edge` variable for edge detection in the next cycle.", "name": "SH"}

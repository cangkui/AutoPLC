{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `NET_VAR_BUFFER`, designed to handle input and output operations for network variable buffers (`BUF_IN` and `BUF_OUT`). The function block uses the `NET_VAR_DATA` structure (`X`) to manage buffer state, indexing, and error handling. Key functionalities include initializing the buffer, writing data to the network buffer, and reading data from the network buffer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `BUF_IN` and `BUF_OUT` are byte arrays of length 64, used to store input and output data respectively; `X` is a `NET_VAR_DATA` structure that manages buffer state, indexing, and error information.\n - Output Variable: `ID` is a byte used to uniquely identify the current function block.\n - Internal Variables: `size` stores the buffer size; `init` is a boolean flag indicating whether initialization has occurred; `index` and `index2` are integer variables used to manage buffer indexing.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization\n   During the first execution of the function block, `init` is `FALSE`, triggering the initialization logic. `X.ID_MAX` is incremented by 1, and `ID` is set to the value of `X.ID_MAX`. `init` is then set to `TRUE` to ensure the initialization logic runs only once.\n\n-- REGION Data Operations\n   If `X.STATE` is greater than 0 and `X.ERROR_ID` is 0, data operations begin. Depending on the value of `X.STATE`, different logic is executed:\n   - If `X.STATE` is 1, data from `BUF_IN` is written to the network buffer. First, the size of `BUF_IN` is calculated, and a check is performed to ensure the write operation does not exceed buffer capacity. If it does, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current `ID` to indicate an error. Otherwise, `ID`, the operation code (`BYTE#20`), and the data size are sequentially written to the buffer, followed by copying the data from `BUF_IN` byte by byte.\n   - If `X.STATE` is 2, data is read from the network buffer into `BUF_OUT`. First, the buffer's `ID` and operation code are checked for a match. If they don't match, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current `ID` to indicate an error. Otherwise, the data size is read, and the buffer data is copied byte by byte into `BUF_OUT`.\n   After each operation, `X.index` is updated to reflect the current buffer index position.\n\n-- REGION Completion\n   Once the function block's logic is executed, the operation concludes.", "name": "NET_VAR_BUFFER"}

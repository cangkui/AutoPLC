{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `SENSOR_INT` and is used to calculate the internal resistance of a sensor based on the input voltage, current, and given resistance values. The output of the function is a real number representing the calculated internal resistance of the sensor.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `Voltage` (voltage), `Current` (current), `RP` (resistance P), `RS` (resistance S).\n  - Internal variable: `RG` (calculated resistance value).\n  - Output variable: `SENSOR_INT` (internal resistance of the sensor).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculation Logic\n     - First, check if the input variable `Current` is not equal to 0.0. If `Current` is 0, skip the calculation, and the function will not perform any operation.\n     - If `Current` is not equal to 0.0, calculate the value of `RG` using the formula `RG = Voltage / Current`. Here, `RG` represents the resistance value calculated from voltage and current.\n     - Next, use the values of `RG`, `RP`, and `RS` to calculate `SENSOR_INT` with the formula `SENSOR_INT = RP * (RG - RS) / (RP + RS - RG)`. This formula is used to determine the internal resistance of the sensor.\n     - Finally, the function returns the calculated value of `SENSOR_INT`.", "name": "SENSOR_INT"}

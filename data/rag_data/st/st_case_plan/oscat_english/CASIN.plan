{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CASIN`, which calculates the arcsine (inverse sine) of a complex number. The function takes a complex number as input and returns another complex number as the result. The implementation is based on the mathematical properties of complex numbers and indirectly computes the arcsine by calling another function, `CASINH` (the inverse hyperbolic sine of a complex number).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `complex`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Internal variable: `Y`, of type `complex`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculate Intermediate Value\n    First, the function swaps and negates the real and imaginary parts of the input complex number to obtain the intermediate result `Y`. Specifically:\n    - `Y.re := -X.im`: The imaginary part of the input is negated and assigned to the real part of `Y`.\n    - `Y.im := X.re`: The real part of the input is directly assigned to the imaginary part of `Y`.\n    This step rotates the complex number `X` by 90 degrees and negates it, preparing it for subsequent calculations.\n\n  -- REGION: Call Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Function\n    Next, the function calls `CASINH` to compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of `Y` and reassigns the result to `Y`. `CASINH` is the inverse hyperbolic sine function for complex numbers, which is mathematically closely related to the arcsine function.\n\n  -- REGION: Compute Final Result\n    Finally, the function swaps and negates the real and imaginary parts of `Y` to obtain the final result:\n    - `CASIN.re := Y.im`: The imaginary part of `Y` is assigned to the real part of the result.\n    - `CASIN.im := -Y.re`: The real part of `Y` is negated and assigned to the imaginary part of the result.\n    This step adjusts the computed result back to the correct form, ensuring it aligns with the definition of the arcsine function.\n\n- Output\n  The function outputs a complex number whose value is the arcsine of the input complex number `X`. This result is obtained indirectly through a series of complex operations and function calls.", "name": "CASIN"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `FLOAT_TO_REAL`, which converts a floating-point number in string format to a `REAL` type numerical value. The function handles the sign, integer part, fractional part, and scientific notation in the string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `FLT`, representing the input floating-point number as a string.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the input string, used to access characters one by one.\n    - `i`: A loop counter for traversing the string.\n    - `X`: The ASCII value of the current character.\n    - `sign`: A sign flag, defaulting to 1 (positive), and set to -1 if a negative sign is detected.\n    - `stop`: The length of the string, used to control the loop range.\n    - `tmp`: A temporary variable for storing the converted integer part.\n    - `d`: The number of decimal places, used to handle scientific notation.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Sign Detection\n    This region detects the sign in the string. It traverses the string to find the first numeric character or decimal point. If a negative sign is encountered, `sign` is set to -1.\n  -- REGION Integer Part Processing\n    This region processes the integer part of the string. Starting from the position after the sign detection, it processes each character, converts numeric characters to integers, and accumulates them into `tmp` until a decimal point, scientific notation symbol (E or e), or the end of the string is encountered.\n  -- REGION Fractional Part Processing\n    If a decimal point is detected, the fractional part is processed. Numeric characters in the fractional part are converted to integers and accumulated into `tmp`, while `d` is decremented to record the number of decimal places until a scientific notation symbol or the end of the string is encountered.\n  -- REGION Scientific Notation Handling\n    If a scientific notation symbol (E or e) is detected, the exponent part is extracted and converted to an integer, which is then added to `d`.\n  -- REGION Result Calculation\n    Finally, based on the value of `d`, the power of 10 is calculated, multiplied by `tmp` and `sign`, and the result is converted to the `REAL` type and returned.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns the converted `REAL` type numerical value, which is the result of processing the sign, integer part, fractional part, and scientific notation in the string-formatted floating-point number.", "name": "FLOAT_TO_REAL"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a functional block named `STAIR2`, designed to implement a step function. It calculates the output value `Y` based on the input value `X` and the step size `D`. If the step size `D` is greater than 0, the output `Y` is the value of `X` rounded down to the nearest multiple of `D`; otherwise, the output `Y` is directly equal to the input `X`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` (input value), `D` (step size).\n  - Output variable: `Y` (output value).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     - First, check whether the step size `D` is greater than 0.\n     - If `D` is greater than 0, further check whether the input value `X` is greater than or equal to the current output value `Y` plus the step size `D`, or whether `X` is less than or equal to the current output value `Y` minus the step size `D`. If the condition is met, calculate the value of `Y` by setting it to the floor division of `X` by `D`, multiplied by `D`.\n     - If `D` is not greater than 0, directly set the output value `Y` to the input value `X`.\n\n- Output Result\n  - The output value `Y` is the step value calculated based on the input value `X` and the step size `D`. If the step size `D` is valid, `Y` is the value of `X` rounded down to the nearest multiple of `D`; otherwise, `Y` is directly equal to `X`.", "name": "STAIR2"}

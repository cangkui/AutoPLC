{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a simple function `KMH_TO_MS` to convert speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s). The conversion is based on the unit relationship: 1 km/h = 0.2777777777777 m/s.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `kmh`, representing the speed value in kilometers per hour, with the data type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Conversion Logic:\n      The core logic of the function multiplies the input `kmh` value by the conversion factor `0.2777777777777` to obtain the speed value in meters per second, and assigns the result to the function's return value `KMH_TO_MS`.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function's return value `KMH_TO_MS` is the speed value in meters per second, with the data type `REAL`.", "name": "KMH_TO_MS"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `FSTRING_TO_DWORD`, is designed to convert a specifically formatted string into a `DWORD` type data. It supports string inputs in multiple numeral systems, including binary, octal, hexadecimal, and decimal, and performs the conversion based on the prefix of the input string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe following variables are defined in the code:\n - Input variable: `IN`, of type `STRING[40]`, representing the string to be converted.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION String Conversion Logic\n   The core logic of the function involves checking the prefix of the input string and calling the corresponding conversion function:\n   - If the input string has the prefix `2#`, it is treated as a binary string. The function removes the prefix and calls the `BIN_TO_DWORD` function to convert it to a `DWORD` type.\n   - If the input string has the prefix `8#`, it is treated as an octal string. The function removes the prefix and calls the `OCT_TO_DWORD` function to convert it to a `DWORD` type.\n   - If the input string has the prefix `16#`, it is treated as a hexadecimal string. The function removes the prefix and calls the `HEX_TO_DWORD` function to convert it to a `DWORD` type.\n   - If the input string does not have any of the above prefixes, it is treated as a decimal string by default. The function calls the `CLEAN` function to remove non-numeric characters from the string and then calls the `DEC_TO_DWORD` function to convert it to a `DWORD` type.\n\n   Finally, the function returns the converted `DWORD` type data.", "name": "FSTRING_TO_DWORD"}

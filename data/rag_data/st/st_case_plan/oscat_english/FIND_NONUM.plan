{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `FIND_NONUM`, is used to locate the first non-numeric character (i.e., a character not in the range '0' to '9' and not a decimal point '.') in a given string, starting from a specified position. If no non-numeric character is found, it returns 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `str` (the string to search), `pos` (the starting position for the search).\n - Internal variables: `i` (loop counter), `pt` (pointer to the string), `end` (length of the string), `X` (byte value of the current character).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   - `pt` is initialized to point to the address of the input string `str`.\n   - `end` is initialized to the length of the string `str`, obtained via `LEN(str)`.\n   - `MAX(pos,1)` ensures the starting position `i` is at least 1 to avoid invalid positions.\n\n-- REGION Searching for Non-Numeric Characters\n   - A `FOR` loop iterates from the starting position `i` to the end of the string `end`.\n   - In each iteration, the byte value `X` of the current character is retrieved via the pointer `pt`.\n   - Checks if `X` is a non-numeric character:\n     - If `X` is less than the ASCII value of '0' (48) and not equal to the ASCII value of '.' (46), or if `X` is greater than the ASCII value of '9' (57), the current character is non-numeric.\n   - If a non-numeric character is found, its position `i` is assigned to `FIND_NONUM`, and the function returns immediately.\n   - If the loop completes without finding a non-numeric character, `FIND_NONUM` is set to 0.\n\n-- REGION Returning the Result\n   - The function returns the value of `FIND_NONUM`, which is either the position of the first non-numeric character or 0.", "name": "FIND_NONUM"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `DEW_RH`, which calculates the Relative Humidity (RH). The function takes Water Vapor Content (VC) and Temperature (T) as inputs, calls another function `DEW_CON` to compute the dew point temperature, and finally constrains the relative humidity value between 0% and 100%.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `VC` (Water Vapor Content, type REAL) and `T` (Temperature, type REAL).\n - Output variable: The return value `DEW_RH` (Relative Humidity, type REAL).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate Relative Humidity\n   - The core logic of this function involves calling the `DEW_CON` function to compute the dew point temperature. The first argument passed to `DEW_CON` is a constant `1.0`, and the second argument is the input temperature `T`.\n   - Next, the input Water Vapor Content `VC` is divided by the result from `DEW_CON` to obtain a preliminary relative humidity value.\n   - Finally, the `LIMIT` function is used to clamp the relative humidity between 0.0 and 100.0, ensuring the output remains within a reasonable range.\n   - The computed result is assigned to `DEW_RH` and returned as the function's output.", "name": "DEW_RH"}

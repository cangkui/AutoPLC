{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function named `GOLD` that takes a real number input `X` and returns a real value calculated based on `X`. The function implements the golden ratio formula.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input value of the function, with the type `REAL`.\n  - Return value: `GOLD`, representing the output value of the function, with the type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating the Golden Ratio\n    The function's logic is straightforward, directly implementing the golden ratio formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{GOLD} = \\frac{X + \\sqrt{X^2 + 4.0}}{2}\n    \\]\n    The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Calculate the square of `X`: `X * X`.\n    2. Add 4.0 to the squared result: `X * X + 4.0`.\n    3. Take the square root of the above result: `SQRT(X * X + 4.0)`.\n    4. Add `X` to the square root result: `X + SQRT(X * X + 4.0)`.\n    5. Multiply the above result by 0.5 (i.e., divide by 2): `(X + SQRT(X * X + 4.0)) * 0.5`.\n    6. Assign the final result to `GOLD` and return it.\n\n    This formula is typically used to calculate the golden ratio. When `X` is 1.0, the result of `GOLD` is the golden ratio value (approximately 1.618).", "name": "GOLD"}

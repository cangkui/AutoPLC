{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block, named `CALIBRATE`, is used to calibrate the input value `X`. The calibration process involves adjusting an offset (Offset) and a scaling factor (Scale), ultimately outputting the calibrated value `Y`. The function block supports calibrating the offset and scaling factor separately via input signals `CO` and `CS`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` (value to be calibrated), `CO` (offset calibration signal), `CS` (scaling factor calibration signal), `Y_Offset` (target offset), `Y_Scale` (target scaling factor).\n  - Output variable: `Y` (calibrated value).\n  - Retentive variables: `offset` (current offset), `Scale` (current scaling factor, default value is 1.0).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calibration Logic\n     - Offset Calibration: When `CO` is true, the current offset `offset` is calculated. The formula is: `offset = Y_Offset - X`. This means the offset is the difference between the target offset `Y_Offset` and the current input value `X`.\n     - Scaling Factor Calibration: When `CS` is true, the current scaling factor `Scale` is calculated. The formula is: `Scale = Y_Scale / (X + offset)`. This means the scaling factor is the ratio of the target scaling factor `Y_Scale` to the current input value `X` plus the offset `offset`.\n     - Output Calculation: Regardless of whether calibration is performed, the final output `Y` is calculated using the formula: `Y = (X + offset) * Scale`. This formula adds the offset `offset` to the input value `X` and then multiplies by the scaling factor `Scale` to obtain the calibrated value.\n\n  -- REGION Retentive Variables\n     - `offset` and `Scale` are retentive variables, meaning their values persist between executions of the function block. This allows calibration results to be retained across multiple calls to the function block without needing recalculation each time.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block calibrates the input value `X` using an offset and a scaling factor, outputting the calibrated value `Y`. The calibration process can be triggered separately via input signals `CO` and `CS`. The retentive variables `offset` and `Scale` ensure the persistence of calibration results, making it suitable for scenarios requiring repeated calibrations.", "name": "CALIBRATE"}

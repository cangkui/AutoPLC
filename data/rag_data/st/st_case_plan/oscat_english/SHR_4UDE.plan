{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The functional block `SHR_4UDE` implements a 4-bit bidirectional shift register. It can perform left or right shift operations based on input signals and supports set and reset functions. Shift operations are triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `SET` (set), `D0` (data input 0), `D3` (data input 3), `CLK` (clock), `DN` (direction control), `RST` (reset).\n  - Output variables: `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` (representing the 4-bit output of the shift register).\n  - Internal variables: `trig` (used to detect the rising edge of the clock signal).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization and Clock Detection\n     - Uses the `R_TRIG` functional block to detect the rising edge of the clock signal `CLK` and stores the result in `trig.Q`.\n  \n  -- REGION Set and Reset Logic\n     - If `SET` or `RST` is true, the set or reset operation is executed:\n       - If `RST` is true, `Q0` is set to `FALSE`, and `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` take the same value as `Q0`, meaning all outputs are reset to `FALSE`.\n       - If `SET` is true, `Q0` is set to `TRUE`, and `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` take the same value as `Q0`, meaning all outputs are set to `TRUE`.\n\n  -- REGION Shift Logic\n     - If a rising edge of the clock signal is detected (i.e., `trig.Q` is true), a left or right shift operation is performed based on the value of `DN`:\n       - If `DN` is true, a right shift is performed:\n         - `Q0` takes the value of `Q1`.\n         - `Q1` takes the value of `Q2`.\n         - `Q2` takes the value of `Q3`.\n         - `Q3` takes the value of input `D3`.\n       - If `DN` is false, a left shift is performed:\n         - `Q3` takes the value of `Q2`.\n         - `Q2` takes the value of `Q1`.\n         - `Q1` takes the value of `Q0`.\n         - `Q0` takes the value of input `D0`.\n\n  -- REGION Output Update\n     - After the shift or set/reset operation is completed, the values of outputs `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` are updated according to the logic.", "name": "SHR_4UDE"}

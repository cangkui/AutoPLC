{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code snippet defines a simple function block `TN_SC_READ_CHAR`, which reads a character from the screen buffer at specified coordinates. It calculates an offset to access the character in the screen buffer and outputs the result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `Iin_X` and `Iin_Y`, representing the coordinate positions on the screen.\n  - Output variable: `Oby_CHAR`, representing the character read from the screen buffer.\n  - Local variable: `in_Offset`, used to calculate the offset within the screen buffer.\n  - Input/output variable: `Xus_TN_SCREEN`, representing the screen buffer, which contains a character array `bya_CHAR`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Input Validation\n    First, the code calls the `TN_SC_XY_ERROR` function to check if the input coordinates `Iin_X` and `Iin_Y` are valid. If the coordinates are invalid (e.g., out of screen bounds), the function returns immediately without further execution.\n\n  -- REGION Offset Calculation\n    If the coordinates are valid, the code calculates the offset `in_Offset` within the screen buffer. The formula for the offset is: `in_Offset := (Iin_Y * 80) + Iin_X`. Here, it assumes the screen width is 80 characters, so `Iin_Y * 80` represents the starting position of the current row, and adding `Iin_X` gives the current column position.\n\n  -- REGION Character Reading\n    Using the calculated offset `in_Offset`, the code retrieves the corresponding character from the screen buffer `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_CHAR` and assigns it to the output variable `Oby_CHAR`.\n\n  -- REGION Completion\n    After execution, the function block returns the read character `Oby_CHAR`.", "name": "TN_SC_READ_CHAR"}

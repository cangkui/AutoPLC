{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `OCT_TO_BYTE` that converts an octal string (OCT) into a byte (BYTE) type. Each character in the octal string represents an octal digit (0-7). The function processes the string by converting each character to its corresponding numerical value and combines these values to form a byte.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code includes the following variables:\n - Input variable: `OCT`, a string of length 10 representing an octal number.\n - Local variables:\n   - `pt`: A pointer to traverse the string character by character.\n   - `i`: A loop counter for iterating through the string.\n   - `X`: Stores the ASCII value of the current character.\n   - `stop`: The length of the string, used to determine the loop termination condition.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   1. The `ADR` function retrieves the address of the input string `OCT` and assigns it to the pointer `pt`.\n   2. The `LEN` function determines the length of `OCT` and assigns it to `stop` to set the loop termination condition.\n\n-- REGION String Traversal and Conversion\n   1. A `FOR` loop iterates through each character in the string, starting from 1 up to `stop`.\n   2. Within the loop, the pointer `pt` accesses the current character, and its ASCII value is stored in `X`.\n   3. The code checks if `X` is a valid octal character (i.e., ASCII value between 48 and 55, corresponding to characters '0' to '7').\n   4. If valid:\n      - The current result `OCT_TO_BYTE` is left-shifted by 3 bits (equivalent to multiplying by 8) to make space for the next octal digit.\n      - The value of `X` is reduced by 48 (converting ASCII to numerical value) and added to `OCT_TO_BYTE`.\n   5. The pointer `pt` is incremented to move to the next character.\n\n-- REGION Result Return\n   After the loop completes, the function returns `OCT_TO_BYTE`, the converted byte value.\n\n- Example\nAssume the input string `OCT` is \"123\". The function execution proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialization: `pt` points to the first character '1', and `stop` is set to 3.\n2. First iteration:\n   - `X` is 49 (ASCII for '1').\n   - `OCT_TO_BYTE` is left-shifted by 3 (initial 0 remains 0), then 1 (49-48) is added, resulting in 1.\n3. Second iteration:\n   - `X` is 50 (ASCII for '2').\n   - `OCT_TO_BYTE` is left-shifted by 3 (1 becomes 8), then 2 (50-48) is added, resulting in 10.\n4. Third iteration:\n   - `X` is 51 (ASCII for '3').\n   - `OCT_TO_BYTE` is left-shifted by 3 (10 becomes 80), then 3 (51-48) is added, resulting in 83.\n5. Return result: `OCT_TO_BYTE` is 83, the decimal equivalent of the octal \"123\".\n\n- Summary\nThe function processes each character in the input string, converts it to its corresponding octal value, and combines these values through bit-shifting and addition to form a byte. The final converted byte value is then returned.", "name": "OCT_TO_BYTE"}

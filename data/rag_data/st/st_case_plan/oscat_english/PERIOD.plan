{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `PERIOD` is used to determine whether a date `dx` falls within the interval defined by two dates `d1` and `d2`. The function accounts for leap years and returns a boolean value indicating whether `dx` is within the interval.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `d1`, `dx`, `d2`, representing the start date of the interval, the target date, and the end date, respectively.\n  - Internal variables: `day1`, `day2`, `dayx`, representing the day of the year (adjusted for leap years) for `d1`, `d2`, and `dx`, respectively.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating the day of the year for a date\n     - Use the `DAY_OF_YEAR` function to convert dates `d1`, `d2`, and `dx` into their respective day-of-year values, stored in `day1`, `day2`, and `dayx`.\n     - If the date `dx` is not a leap year and its day count exceeds 58 (i.e., after February 28), increment `dayx` by 1 to handle leap year edge cases.\n     - Apply the same adjustment to `d1` and `d2` to ensure all date calculations account for leap years.\n\n  -- REGION Determining if the date falls within the interval\n     - If `day2` is less than `day1`, it indicates the interval spans the end and start of the year (e.g., December 31 to January 1). In this case, `dx` is within the interval if `dayx` is less than or equal to `day2` OR `dayx` is greater than or equal to `day1`.\n     - If `day2` is greater than or equal to `day1`, the interval lies within the same year. Here, `dx` is within the interval if `dayx` is greater than or equal to `day1` AND less than or equal to `day2`.\n     - Assign the result to `PERIOD` based on the above conditions.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns a boolean value `PERIOD`, indicating whether `dx` falls within the interval defined by `d1` and `d2`.", "name": "PERIOD"}

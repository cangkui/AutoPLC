Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named 'SPHERE_V' to calculate the volume of a sphere. The function takes a real number input 'rx', representing the radius of the sphere, and returns the computed volume.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: rx, representing the radius of the sphere, with a type of REAL (real number).\n  \n  No other variables are defined within the function; the input variable is used directly for calculations.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Sphere Volume\n     This region contains the core logic of the function, responsible for calculating the sphere's volume. The formula is:\n    ```\n    sphere_V := 4.188790205 * rx * rx * rx;\n    ```\n     Here, '4.188790205' is a constant (i.e., 4/3 * Ï€) used in the sphere volume formula. The function multiplies the cube of the radius 'rx' by this constant to obtain the sphere's volume and assigns the result to the function name 'sphere_V', which serves as the return value.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns the computed sphere volume, with a type of REAL.", "name": "SPHERE_V"}

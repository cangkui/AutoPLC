{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `BFT_TO_MS`, which converts wind force levels (BFT, Beaufort Scale) to wind speed (m/s, meters per second). The conversion is based on an empirical relationship that transforms Beaufort Scale values into wind speeds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `BFT`, representing the wind force level, of type `INT` (integer).\n  - Output variable: `BFT_TO_MS`, representing the converted wind speed, of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Conversion Calculation\n     This section handles the conversion from wind force level to wind speed. The specific logic is as follows:\n     1. Use the `EXPT` function to calculate `BFT` raised to the power of 1.5, i.e., `BFT^1.5`.\n     2. Multiply the result by the constant `0.836` to obtain the final wind speed value.\n     3. Assign the computed wind speed value to the output variable `BFT_TO_MS`.\n\n  Formula Explanation:\n  - `BFT_TO_MS := EXPT(BFT, 1.5) * 0.836`: This is the empirical conversion formula from Beaufort Scale to wind speed. `EXPT(BFT, 1.5)` denotes `BFT` raised to the 1.5 power, and `0.836` is an empirical coefficient used to convert the result to meters per second.\n\n  Example:\n  - If the input is `BFT = 5`, the calculation proceeds as follows:\n    - `5^1.5 ≈ 11.18`\n    - `11.18 * 0.836 ≈ 9.34`\n    - Thus, `BFT_TO_MS = 9.34`, indicating that a Beaufort Scale level 5 corresponds to a wind speed of approximately 9.34 meters per second.\n\n  Notes:\n  - This formula is based on empirical relationships and is suitable for general cases but may not apply to all scenarios.\n  - The input `BFT` should be a valid Beaufort Scale value (typically an integer between 0 and 12).", "name": "BFT_TO_MS"}

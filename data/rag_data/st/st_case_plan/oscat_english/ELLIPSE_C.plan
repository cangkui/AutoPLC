{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `ELLIPSE_C` that calculates the circumference of an ellipse. It takes two input parameters, `R1` and `R2`, representing the lengths of the two semi-axes of the ellipse, and returns the calculated circumference value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `R1` and `R2`, representing the lengths of the two semi-axes of the ellipse.\n  - Output variable: `ELLIPSE_C`, representing the computed circumference of the ellipse.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Ellipse Circumference\n      This region implements the formula for calculating the circumference of an ellipse. The formula is as follows:\n      \\[\n      \\text{ELLIPSE\\_C} = \\pi \\times \\left(3 \\times (R1 + R2) - \\sqrt{(3 \\times R1 + R2) \\times (3 \\times R2 + R1)}\\right)\n      \\]\n      The specific steps are:\n      1. Calculate the sum of `R1` and `R2`, then multiply by 3.\n      2. Compute the product of `(3 * R1 + R2)` and `(3 * R2 + R1)`, then take the square root.\n      3. Subtract the result from step 2 from the result of step 1.\n      4. Multiply the final result by the mathematical constant `Ï€` to obtain the circumference of the ellipse and assign it to the output variable `ELLIPSE_C`.", "name": "ELLIPSE_C"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function called `DEW_CON` used to calculate a value related to dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor in the air becomes saturated. The function computes the output value based on the input relative humidity and temperature.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `RH` (relative humidity, ranging from 0 to 100), `T` (temperature, in degrees Celsius).\n  - Output variable: `DEW_CON` (computation result, of real type).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Computation Logic\n     - The function first checks the validity of the inputs: relative humidity `RH` must be greater than 0.0, and temperature `T` must be greater than -50.0.\n     - If the inputs are valid, the computation logic is executed. The calculation uses the following formula:\n       \\[\n       \\text{DEW\\_CON} = \\frac{2.166824303 \\times 10^{-2} \\times \\text{RH} \\times \\text{SDD}(T, \\text{FALSE})}{T - \\text{OSCAT\\_BASIC.phys.T0}}\n       \\]\n       Where:\n       - `SDD(T, FALSE)` is a function that calculates the saturation density of water vapor in relation to temperature `T`.\n       - `OSCAT_BASIC.phys.T0` is a constant representing a reference temperature (typically absolute zero or the freezing point of water).\n     - If the inputs are invalid (i.e., `RH` or `T` do not meet the conditions), `DEW_CON` is set to 0.0.\n  -- REGION End\n     - The function returns the computed `DEW_CON` value.", "name": "DEW_CON"}

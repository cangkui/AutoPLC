{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `SECOND_TO_TIME`, is designed to convert an input value in seconds (of `REAL` type) into a `TIME` type value. The `TIME` type is a commonly used time data type in PLCs, typically measured in milliseconds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one input variable:\n  - `IN`: The input variable, of type `REAL`, representing the time value in seconds.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The function's logic is very straightforward and consists of the following steps:\n    1. Multiply the input seconds (`IN`) by 1000 to convert them into milliseconds (since the `TIME` type uses milliseconds as its unit).\n    2. Use the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function to convert the `REAL` type millisecond value into a `DWORD` type.\n    3. Use the `DWORD_TO_TIME` function to convert the `DWORD` type millisecond value into a `TIME` type.\n    4. Assign the result to the function name `SECOND_TO_TIME`, which serves as the function's return value.\n\n  Ultimately, the function returns a `TIME` type value representing the input seconds converted into milliseconds.", "name": "SECOND_TO_TIME"}

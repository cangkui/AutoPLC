{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a functional block with hysteresis characteristics, named 'HYST'. Based on the comparison between the input value `In` and two thresholds `ON` and `OFF`, it outputs a boolean value `Q` and indicates whether the input value is within the hysteresis window (`win`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `In` (input value), `ON` (activation threshold), `OFF` (deactivation threshold).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output boolean value), `win` (indicates whether the input value is within the hysteresis window).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the functional block determines the relationship between the input value `In` and the thresholds `ON` and `OFF`, updating the outputs `Q` and `win` based on hysteresis characteristics.\n     - If `ON` is greater than or equal to `OFF`:\n       1. If `In` is less than `OFF`, the output `Q` is `FALSE`, and `win` is `FALSE`.\n       2. If `In` is greater than `ON`, the output `Q` is `TRUE`, and `win` is `FALSE`.\n       3. If `In` is between `OFF` and `ON`, `win` is `TRUE`, indicating the input value is within the hysteresis window.\n     - If `ON` is less than `OFF`:\n       1. If `In` is greater than `OFF`, the output `Q` is `FALSE`, and `win` is `FALSE`.\n       2. If `In` is less than `ON`, the output `Q` is `TRUE`, and `win` is `FALSE`.\n       3. If `In` is between `ON` and `OFF`, `win` is `TRUE`, indicating the input value is within the hysteresis window.\n     This design allows the functional block to achieve hysteresis characteristics across different threshold ranges, ensuring the output `Q` does not toggle frequently as the input value changes.", "name": "HYST"}

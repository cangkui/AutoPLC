Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function named `SHL1` is designed to perform a left shift operation with overflow handling. It takes a 32-bit unsigned integer (`IN`) and an integer (`N`) as inputs, and returns the result after the left shift. The function combines `SHR` and `SHL` operations to manage potential overflow during the left shift process.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `IN`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the value to be left-shifted.\n    - `N`: An integer indicating the number of bits to shift left.\n  - Constant variables:\n    - `temp`: A 32-bit unsigned integer initialized to `16#FFFFFFFF` (all bits set to 1), used to assist in calculations.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function involves combining `SHR` and `SHL` operations to achieve the left shift. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Use the `SHR` operation to right-shift the constant `temp` by `(32 - N)` bits. This generates a mask to capture the overflowed bits during the left shift.\n    2. Use the `SHL` operation to left-shift the input value `IN` by `N` bits. This is the standard left shift operation.\n    3. Perform an `OR` operation on the two results above to combine the left-shifted value and the overflowed bits, yielding the final result.\n  - For example, if `IN` is `16#00000001` and `N` is 1:\n    - `SHR(temp, 32-1)` would produce `16#80000000` (the highest bit is 1, others are 0).\n    - `SHL(IN, 1)` would produce `16#00000002` (left-shifted by one bit).\n    - The final result would be `16#80000002`, combining the left-shifted value and the overflowed highest bit.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the result of left-shifting the input `IN` by `N` bits, with overflow properly handled.", "name": "SHL1"}

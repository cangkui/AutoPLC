{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `F_LIN` for calculating the value of a linear equation. The function takes three input parameters: `X`, `A`, and `B`, and returns a value of type `REAL`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines three types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X`, `A`, and `B`, representing the input value, slope, and intercept of the linear equation, respectively.\n  - Output variable: `F_LIN`, representing the computed result of the linear equation.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Linear Equation\n     This region implements the calculation logic for the linear equation. First, it computes the value of the linear equation using the formula `F_LIN := A * X + B`. Then, it returns the computed result as the function's output.", "name": "F_LIN"}

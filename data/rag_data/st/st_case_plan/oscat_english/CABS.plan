{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `CABS` for calculating the absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number. The absolute value of a complex number represents its distance from the origin in the complex plane and can be derived from its real and imaginary parts.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing a complex number. A complex number typically consists of a real part (`x.re`) and an imaginary part (`x.im`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute the Absolute Value of a Complex Number\n    The function's logic is straightforwardâ€”it directly calls a function named `HYPOT` to compute the absolute value. The `HYPOT` function calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of two numbers, expressed as:\n    \\[\n    \\text{HYPOT}(a, b) = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n    \\]\n    Here, `HYPOT(x.re, x.im)` computes the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, yielding its absolute value:\n    \\[\n    \\text{CABS} = \\sqrt{(\\text{x.re})^2 + (\\text{x.im})^2}\n    \\]\n    The result is directly assigned to the function's return value, `CABS`.\n\n- Summary\nThe core of this function lies in its use of the `HYPOT` function to compute the absolute value of a complex number. The absolute value represents the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane and is a real-valued quantity. By taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, this result is efficiently calculated.", "name": "CABS"}

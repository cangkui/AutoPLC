{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function `V3_ANG` is used to calculate the angle between two 3D vectors `A` and `B`. The function returns the cosine of the angle and computes the angle in radians using the inverse cosine function (`ACOS`).  

- Variable Definitions  
The code defines the following types of variables:  
 - Input variables: `A` and `B`, both of type `Vector_3`, representing the two 3D vectors.  
 - Internal variable: `d`, of type `REAL`, used to store the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors.  

- Main Logic  
-- REGION Calculate Angle  
   1. First, compute the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors, i.e., `d := V3_ABS(A) * V3_ABS(B)`. Here, `V3_ABS` is a hypothetical function used to calculate the magnitude (length) of a vector.  
   2. Check if `d` is greater than 0. If `d` > 0, proceed to calculate the angle.  
   3. Compute the dot product of the two vectors `V3_DPRO(A, B)`, then divide it by `d` to obtain the cosine of the angle. Here, `V3_DPRO` is a hypothetical function used to calculate the dot product of two vectors.  
   4. Use the `LIMIT` function to constrain the cosine value within the range `[-1.0, 1.0]` to ensure the input for the inverse cosine function is valid.  
   5. Finally, use the inverse cosine function `ACOS` to compute the angle in radians and assign it to the function's return value `V3_ANG`.  

-- REGION Return Value  
   If `d` is not greater than 0, the function performs no operation and directly returns a default value (unspecified, possibly 0 or another default).", "name": "V3_ANG"}

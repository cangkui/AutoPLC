  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `FRMP_B` calculates a byte value based on the input starting value (`START`), direction (`DIR`), delay time (`TD`), and reference time (`TR`). Depending on the relationship between `TD` and `TR`, combined with the direction `DIR`, it dynamically adjusts the output value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `START`: Starting value, of type `BYTE`.\n    - `DIR`: Direction, of type `BOOL`, determining whether to increment or decrement.\n    - `TD`: Delay time, of type `TIME`.\n    - `TR`: Reference time, of type `TIME`.\n  - Output variable:\n    - `FRMP_B`: Result of the calculation, of type `BYTE`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculation Logic\n      1. **Compare `TD` and `TR`**:\n         - If `TD` is less than `TR`, perform the following steps:\n           - Convert `TD` and `TR` to `DWORD` type.\n           - Left-shift `TD` by 8 bits, then divide by `TR` to obtain a proportional value.\n           - Convert the proportional value to `BYTE` type, ensuring it does not exceed `START` or `255 - START` (depending on the direction `DIR`).\n           - If `DIR` is true (increment direction), add the proportional value to `START`.\n           - If `DIR` is false (decrement direction), subtract the proportional value from `START`.\n         - If `TD` is greater than or equal to `TR`, directly output `0` or `255` based on the direction `DIR`.\n      2. **Output Result**:\n         - The final calculated value is stored in `FRMP_B` and returned as the function's output.\n\nThe core logic of this function dynamically adjusts the output based on the time ratio while considering the direction. If the delay time `TD` is less than the reference time `TR`, the output is proportionally adjusted; otherwise, it is set to the minimum or maximum value based on the direction.",

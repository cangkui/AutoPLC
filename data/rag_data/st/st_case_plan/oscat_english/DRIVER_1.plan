{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `DRIVER_1`, which controls a Boolean output `Q`. The block supports multiple operation modes, including direct setting, resetting, input triggering, and timeout control. It uses a timer (`TON`) to implement the timeout functionality.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `Toggle_Mode`: Used to switch between input trigger modes (toggle or direct set).\n    - `Timeout`: Defines the timeout duration for output `Q`.\n    - `SET`: Directly sets output `Q` to `TRUE`.\n    - `IN`: Input signal used to trigger output `Q`.\n    - `RST`: Directly resets output `Q` to `FALSE`.\n  - Output Variables:\n    - `Q`: Boolean output representing the state of the functional block.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `off`: A `TON` timer instance for implementing timeout functionality.\n    - `edge`: Used to detect the rising edge of the `IN` signal.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Timeout Control\n     If the timer `off`'s output `Q` is `TRUE`, it means the timeout has elapsed, and output `Q` is set to `FALSE`.\n\n  -- REGION Reset Control\n     If input `RST` is `TRUE`, output `Q` is directly set to `FALSE`, bypassing other logic.\n\n  -- REGION Set Control\n     If input `SET` is `TRUE`, output `Q` is directly set to `TRUE`, bypassing other logic.\n\n  -- REGION Input Trigger Control\n     If input `IN` is `TRUE` and a rising edge is detected (i.e., `edge` is `FALSE`), the output `Q` is updated based on `Toggle_Mode`:\n    - If `Toggle_Mode` is `TRUE`, the output `Q` is toggled (i.e., `Q := NOT Q`).\n    - If `Toggle_Mode` is `FALSE`, output `Q` is directly set to `TRUE`.\n\n  -- REGION Edge Detection\n     The `edge` variable is updated to store the current value of `IN` for detecting the rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n  -- REGION Timeout Timer Start\n     If `Timeout` is greater than `0` seconds, the timer `off` is started. The timer's input is the current output `Q`, and its preset time is `Timeout`. If output `Q` is `TRUE`, the timer starts counting; if `Q` becomes `FALSE`, the timer stops and resets.\n\n- Summary\n  This functional block implements multiple control modes through simple logic, including direct setting, resetting, input triggering, and timeout control. It uses a timer to ensure output `Q` automatically resets after the specified timeout, while supporting toggle mode for flexible state changes.", "name": "DRIVER_1"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `CCOS` is used to calculate the cosine of a complex number. It takes a complex number `X` as input and returns its cosine value. The cosine of the complex number is computed by calling the `CCOSH` function, where `CCOSH` is the hyperbolic cosine function for complex numbers.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Output variable: `CCOS`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the computed cosine value of the complex number.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute Complex Cosine\n    The core logic of the function involves calculating the cosine value of the complex number by invoking the `CCOSH` function. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. First, use the `CSET` function to swap the imaginary and real parts of the complex number `X`, resulting in a new complex number `CSET(-X.im, X.re)`. This step converts the cosine calculation into a hyperbolic cosine calculation.\n    2. Next, pass the new complex number obtained in the previous step as an argument to the `CCOSH` function to compute its hyperbolic cosine value.\n    3. Finally, assign the result of the `CCOSH` function to `CCOS`, which serves as the output of the function.\n\n    This logic is based on Euler's formula in mathematics, which states that the cosine of a complex number can be computed using the hyperbolic cosine function. Specifically, the formula for the cosine of a complex number is:\n    \\[\n    \\cos(z) = \\cosh(iz)\n    \\]\n    where \\( z \\) is the complex number and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. By swapping the real and imaginary parts of the complex number and negating the imaginary part, the effect of \\( iz \\) is simulated, allowing the `CCOSH` function to be used to compute the cosine of the complex number.", "name": "CCOS"}

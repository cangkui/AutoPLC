{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple clock function block named `CLK_N`, designed to generate a frequency-adjustable clock signal. The input parameter `N` controls the frequency of the clock signal, and the output `Q` represents the generated clock signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `N`, used to control the frequency of the clock signal.\n  - Output variable: `Q`, representing the generated clock signal.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `edge`: Stores the state of the clock signal from the previous cycle.\n    - `stime`: Stores the time value after a bit-shift operation.\n    - `clk`: Stores the current state of the clock signal.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. **Time Shift**: The function `SHR(T_PLC_MS(), N)` retrieves the current PLC time in milliseconds and right-shifts it by `N` bits. The result is stored in `stime`.\n    2. **Clock Signal Extraction**: The least significant bit (`stime.0`) of `stime` is extracted to determine the current clock signal state, stored in `clk`.\n    3. **Clock Signal Generation**: The output clock signal `Q` is generated by computing `clk XOR edge`. The `XOR` operation ensures that `Q` toggles whenever the state of `clk` changes.\n    4. **Edge Detection Update**: The current value of `clk` is stored in `edge` for use in edge detection during the next cycle.\n\n- Explanation\n  - **Bit-Shift Operation**: `SHR(T_PLC_MS(), N)` right-shifts the current time value by `N` bits, effectively dividing the time value by \\(2^N\\). This causes the state change frequency of `clk` to be inversely proportional to `N`.\n  - **Edge Detection**: Using `clk XOR edge`, the output `Q` toggles whenever the state of `clk` changes. This mechanism generates a square wave signal.\n  - **Application Scenarios**: This function block can be used to generate periodic clock signals, such as for timers, state machines, or other logic requiring periodic triggers.\n\n- Output Result\n  The output `Q` is a Boolean value representing the generated clock signal. Its frequency is controlled by the input parameter `N`â€”the larger `N` is, the lower the frequency.", "name": "CLK_N"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function block written in SCL, named 'TN_FRAMEWORK', designed to manage and control network communication, user input, and screen display functions. It integrates multiple sub-function blocks to handle tasks such as IP control, input control, menu bar, data reception, and transmission.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Internal variables: Include instances of function blocks for IP control, input control, menu bar, reception, transmission rows, and timers (TON).\n  - Input/output variables: Include input control, screen, menu, send buffer, receive buffer, and IP control structures.\n  - Input variables: Port number.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialize IP Control\n    This region initializes the IP control structure. It first checks if IP control is not enabled (IP_C.C_ENABLE is false). If not enabled, it sets the port number (defaulting to 23 if the port is 0), IP address (set to 0), mode (set to 4), enables IP control, and resets the time observation flag. This logic ensures the IP control structure is correctly initialized when the function block starts.\n\n  -- REGION Error Handling\n    This region handles errors in IP control. If an error exists in the IP control structure (IP_C.ERROR > 0), a 5-second timer is started. When the timer expires (t.Q is true), the time observation flag (IP_C.TIME_RESET) is reset. This logic ensures timely reset of related states in case of errors.\n\n  -- REGION Menu Bar Input Control\n    This region calls the menu bar input control function block (FB_TN_INPUT_MENU_BAR) and passes the menu and screen structures as parameters. This logic handles user interactions with the menu bar.\n\n  -- REGION Input Control\n    This region calls the input control function block (FB_TN_INPUT_CONTROL) and passes the screen and input control structures as parameters. This logic manages user input operations on the screen.\n\n  -- REGION Send Data\n    This region calls the transmission row function block (FB_TN_SEND_ROWS) and passes the IP control structure, send buffer, screen structure, and send buffer size as parameters. This logic handles data transmission over the network.\n\n  -- REGION IP Control\n    This region calls the IP control function block (FB_IP_CONTROL) and passes the IP control structure, send buffer, receive buffer, IP address, port number, and timeout duration as parameters. This logic manages the IP control aspects of network communication.\n\n  -- REGION Receive Data\n    This region calls the reception function block (FB_TN_RECEIVE) and passes the receive buffer and screen structure as parameters. This logic handles data reception from the network and updates the screen display accordingly.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block integrates multiple sub-function blocks to achieve comprehensive management of network communication, user input, and screen display. The initialization logic ensures proper configuration of the IP control structure at startup, the error handling logic ensures timely state resets in case of errors, and other logic sections handle tasks such as menu bar, input control, data transmission, IP control, and data reception.", "name": "TN_FRAMEWORK"}

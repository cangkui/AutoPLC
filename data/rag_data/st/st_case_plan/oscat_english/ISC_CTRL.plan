{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `ISC_CTRL` that checks whether an input byte value meets specific conditions. The function returns a Boolean value indicating whether the input value is less than 32 or equal to 127.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BYTE`, representing the input byte value.\n  - Output variable: `ISC_CTRL`, of type `BOOL`, representing the function's return value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n    - If the input byte value `IN` is less than 32, or `IN` equals 127, the function returns `TRUE`.\n    - Otherwise, the function returns `FALSE`.\n    This logic is typically used to check for special or control characters (such as those in the ASCII table), as these characters usually have ASCII values less than 32 or equal to 127 (for example, the delete key has an ASCII value of 127).", "name": "ISC_CTRL"}

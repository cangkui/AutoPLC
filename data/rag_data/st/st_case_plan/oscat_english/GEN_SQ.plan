{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `GEN_SQ`, is used to generate a square wave signal. Its output signal `Q` toggles between high and low levels based on the input time parameter `PT`. The function block achieves square wave generation by tracking the current time and the last toggle time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `PT`, representing the period of the square wave (total time for high and low levels).\n  - Output variable: `Q`, representing the generated square wave signal (Boolean value, where `TRUE` is high level and `FALSE` is low level).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `tn`: Timestamp (in milliseconds) recording the last toggle time.\n    - `tx`: Timestamp (in milliseconds) recording the current time.\n    - `init`: Initialization flag indicating whether the function block has been initialized.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization Logic\n    The function block first retrieves the current time `tx` and stores it in a variable. If the function block has not been initialized (i.e., `init` is `FALSE`), it performs the following initialization steps:\n    - Sets `init` to `TRUE`, indicating the function block is initialized.\n    - Sets `tn` to the current time `tx` as the initial timestamp.\n    - Sets the output `Q` to `TRUE`, representing the initial high-level state of the square wave.\n\n  -- REGION Square Wave Generation Logic\n    If the function block is initialized, it checks whether the difference between the current time `tx` and the last toggle time `tn` is greater than or equal to half the period (i.e., `PT / 2`):\n    - If the condition is met, the output `Q` is toggled (from `TRUE` to `FALSE` or vice versa).\n    - Simultaneously, the last toggle time `tn` is updated to `tn + PT / 2` to ensure the next toggle occurs at the correct time.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function block's output `Q` periodically toggles between high and low levels based on the input time parameter `PT`, generating a square wave signal. The square wave's period is `PT`, with both high and low levels lasting `PT / 2` each.", "name": "GEN_SQ"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'XML_READER', designed to parse XML data. It traverses byte data in a buffer, identifies XML tags, attributes, and values, and stores the parsed results in a control structure.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output variables: CTRL (XML control structure), BUF (long integer buffer)\n - Internal variables: index, index2, stop, mode, command, c, s1, e1, path_overflow, empty_tag, s_code, e_code, watchdog (timer)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This section handles the initialization logic of the function block. First, it checks if the highest bit of the control command is 1. If so, it initializes the function block, including setting the start and end positions, mode, path overflow flag, etc. It also resets fields in the control structure and sets the watchdog timer. The specific steps are:\n   1. If the highest bit of CTRL.COMMAND is 1, it indicates a new command needs processing. The value of CTRL.COMMAND is assigned to the internal variable 'command', and CTRL.COMMAND is reset to 0.\n   2. Convert CTRL.START_POS and CTRL.STOP_POS to integers and assign them to 'index' and 'stop' variables.\n   3. Set the mode to 100, indicating the start of XML tag parsing.\n   4. Reset fields in the control structure, including type, count, level, attributes, elements, path, and value.\n   5. Set the watchdog timer's preset time to CTRL.WATCHDOG.\n\n-- REGION Parsing Loop\n   This section is the core of the function block, using an infinite loop to parse XML data. In the loop, it first checks if the index is out of bounds. If so, it sets the type to 99, indicating parsing is complete, and returns. Otherwise, it executes the corresponding parsing logic based on the current mode.\n   - Mode 100: Find the start of an XML tag. If '<' is found, it checks the next character to determine if it's a start tag, end tag, or comment tag. If it's a start tag, it records the tag's start position and enters mode 400 or 300.\n     1. Initialize s1 and e1 to 0.\n     2. Traverse the buffer to find the '<' character.\n     3. If '<' is found, check the next character:\n        - If it's '/', it's an end tag; enter mode 300.\n        - If it's '!', it's a comment tag; enter mode 500.\n        - Otherwise, record the tag's start position s1 and continue searching for the end position e1.\n     4. If the tag's end position is found, set the type to 1, indicating a start tag is found, and enter mode 400 or 300.\n     5. If '?' is found, it's a processing instruction; set the type to 5.\n     6. Update fields in the control structure, including elements, count, level, and path.\n     7. If path overflow occurs, set the path to 'OVERFLOW'.\n     8. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n   - Mode 200: Find the tag's value. If the tag is not empty, record the value's start and end positions and store the value in the control structure. Then enter mode 300.\n     1. If the tag is not empty, find the value's start position s1 and end position e1.\n     2. Store the value in the VALUE field of the control structure.\n     3. Set the type to 3, indicating the tag's value is found.\n     4. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n   - Mode 300: Find the end of the tag. If '>' is found, update the path based on the path overflow flag and decrease the level. Then enter mode 100.\n     1. Traverse the buffer to find the '>' character.\n     2. If '>' is found, update the path and level.\n     3. Set the type to 2, indicating an end tag is found.\n     4. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n     5. Otherwise, enter mode 100.\n   - Mode 400: Find the tag's attributes. If '=' is found, record the attribute's start and end positions and store the attribute in the control structure. Then, based on the next character, enter mode 100, 200, or 300.\n     1. Skip whitespace characters and find the attribute's start position s1 and end position e1.\n     2. If '=' is found, record the attribute's value.\n     3. Store the attribute and value in the ATTRIBUTE and VALUE fields of the control structure.\n     4. Set the type to 4, indicating an attribute is found.\n     5. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n     6. Based on the next character, enter mode 100, 200, or 300.\n   - Mode 500: Handle comments and CDATA sections. Based on the comment type, record the start and end positions of the comment or CDATA and store them in the control structure. Then enter mode 100.\n     1. Initialize s1 and e1 to 0.\n     2. Based on the comment type, find the start and end positions of the comment or CDATA.\n     3. Store the comment or CDATA in the VALUE field of the control structure.\n     4. Set the type to 12, 13, or 14, indicating a comment or CDATA is found.\n     5. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n     6. Enter mode 100.\n\n-- REGION Output\n   This section stores the parsed results in the control structure. Based on the parsed type, it stores tag, attribute, value, etc., in the corresponding fields and updates the count and level. If the parsed type matches the command, it returns.\n   1. If the parsed type is 99, indicating parsing is complete, reset fields in the control structure and return.\n   2. If the parsed type matches the command, return.\n   3. Otherwise, continue the parsing loop.", "name": "XML_READER"}

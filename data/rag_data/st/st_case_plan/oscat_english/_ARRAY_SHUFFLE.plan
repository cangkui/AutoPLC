{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `_ARRAY_SHUFFLE`, which randomly shuffles the order of elements in a real-number array. The function takes a pointer to the array and the array size as input, returning a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `pt` is a pointer to the real-number array, and `size` is the size of the array.\n  - Internal variables: `temp` is used to temporarily store array elements, `pos` stores randomly generated position indices, `i` is a loop counter, and `stop` is the loop termination condition.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     `stop` is initialized as `size / 4 - 1`, implemented via `UINT_TO_INT(SHR(size, 2) - 1)`. This means the function will only shuffle the first quarter of the array elements.\n\n  -- REGION Shuffling the Array\n     A `FOR` loop iterates through the first quarter of the array. In each iteration:\n     - `pos` is randomly generated within the range `0` to `stop`, implemented via `RDM2(i + pos, 0, stop)`.\n     - The current element `pt^[i]` and the randomly selected element `pt^[pos]` are swapped using `temp` as temporary storage.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     The function returns `TRUE`, indicating the array shuffling operation was successful.\n\n- Summary\n  This function shuffles the array by randomly swapping elements but only operates on the first quarter of the array. The logic is simple and suitable for scenarios requiring partial array shuffling.", "name": "_ARRAY_SHUFFLE"}

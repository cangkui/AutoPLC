{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function `GRAY_TO_BYTE` that converts Gray Code to binary code (Byte). Gray Code is a binary encoding method characterized by the fact that adjacent numbers differ by only one binary digit, often used to reduce errors in data transmission.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BYTE`, representing the input Gray Code.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Gray Code Conversion Logic\n      This region implements the logic for converting Gray Code to binary code. The conversion rule is achieved through stepwise XOR operations, with the following specific steps:\n      1. Right-shift the input Gray Code `IN` by 4 bits, then perform an XOR operation with the original `IN` to obtain an intermediate result.\n      2. Right-shift the result from the previous step by 2 bits, then perform another XOR operation with the previous result to obtain a new intermediate result.\n      3. Right-shift the result from the previous step by 1 bit, then perform another XOR operation with the previous result to obtain the final binary code.\n      4. Assign the final binary code to the function return value `GRAY_TO_BYTE`.\n\n  Through this stepwise XOR approach, the Gray Code is converted into standard binary code. This conversion method leverages the properties of Gray Code, ensuring that each step progressively recovers the original binary value.", "name": "GRAY_TO_BYTE"}

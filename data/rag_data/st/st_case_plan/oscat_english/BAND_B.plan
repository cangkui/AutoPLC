{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple SCL function named `BAND_B`, designed to apply boundary limits to an input byte `X`. The function's logic is as follows: If `X` is less than the lower limit `B`, it returns 0; if `X` is greater than the upper limit `255 - B`, it returns 255; otherwise, it returns `X` unchanged.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `B`, both of type `BYTE`, representing the value to be processed and the boundary value, respectively.\n  - Output variable: `BAND_B`, of type `BYTE`, representing the processed result.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Boundary Limiting Logic\n    This region implements the boundary limiting logic for the input value `X`:\n    - If `X` is less than `B`, `BAND_B` is set to 0, indicating `X` is below the lower limit.\n    - If `X` is greater than `255 - B`, `BAND_B` is set to 255, indicating `X` is above the upper limit.\n    - If `X` is between `B` and `255 - B`, `BAND_B` is set to `X`, indicating `X` is within the valid range.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns `BAND_B`, which is the result after applying the boundary limiting logic.", "name": "BAND_B"}

It retrieves the corresponding weather icon from a predefined icon data array based on Yahoo Weather's weather codes and assigns it to the relevant field in the weather data structure. The function block executes only once when the activation signal transitions from false to true.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `YW`, of type `YAHOO_WEATHER_DATA`, used to store weather data.\n - Input Variables: `ACTIVATE`, of type `BOOL`, used to trigger the execution of the function block.\n - Internal Variables:\n   - `dat`, of type `ARRAY[0..48] OF INT`, a predefined array storing icon indices corresponding to weather codes.\n   - `act_last`, of type `BOOL`, used to store the activation signal state from the previous cycle.\n   - `x`, of type `INT`, a temporary variable for storing the index of the weather code.\n   - `idx`, of type `INT`, used for iterating through weather data in loops.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n -- REGION Main Logic\n    - When the `ACTIVATE` signal transitions from false to true, the function block begins execution.\n    - First, it retrieves the current weather condition code, clamps it between `0` and `48`, then fetches the corresponding icon index from the `dat` array and assigns it to `YW.CUR_CONDITIONS_ICON`.\n    - Next, it retrieves today's forecast weather code, similarly clamped between `0` and `48`, and fetches the corresponding icon index from the `dat` array, assigning it to `YW.FORECAST_TODAY_ICON`.\n    - Then, it uses a `FOR` loop to iterate through the forecast data for the next 9 days. For each day, it retrieves the weather code, clamps it between `0` and `48`, and fetches the corresponding icon index from the `dat` array, assigning it to `YW.FORECAST_DAY[idx].ICON`.\n    - Finally, it updates the `act_last` variable to the current state of the `ACTIVATE` signal to detect the rising edge of the activation signal in the next cycle.",

  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `IRTRANS_SND_8` is used to handle the transmission of infrared signals. It selects an infrared key code based on input signals and sends it to the network buffer. The function block also manages the logic for repeated transmissions and ensures operations are executed only when device status and mode meet the required conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Device code (DEV_CODE), 8 infrared key codes (KEY_CODE_0 to KEY_CODE_7), 8 input signals (IN_0 to IN_7), and repeat transmission time (T_REPEAT).\n  - Input/output variables: IP control structure (IP_C) and network buffer (S_BUF).\n  - Output variable: Currently selected key value (KEY).\n  - Internal variables: Current key code (skey), string length (size), concatenated string (str), timer (t), current key index (k), previous key index (lk), and device status flag (d).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Device Status Check\n     First, it checks whether the device status and mode meet the conditions. If the device status is greater than 127 and (IP_C.MAILBOX[1] > 0 or IP_C.C_MODE != 5), the device status flag `d` is set to true. If the conditions are not met, the function block returns immediately without executing further logic.\n\n  -- REGION Timer Logic\n     A timer `t` is used to handle the repeat transmission logic. The timer's input condition is that the current key index `k` equals the previous key index `lk`, with the timer duration set to `T_REPEAT`. If the condition is met, the timer starts counting.\n\n  -- REGION Key Code Selection\n     If the network buffer `S_BUF` size is 0, the corresponding infrared key code is selected based on the state of input signals `IN_0` to `IN_7`, and the current key index `k` is set. If no input signal is detected, the previous key index `lk` and output key value `KEY` are reset to 0, and the function block returns immediately.\n\n  -- REGION Key Code Transmission\n     If the current key index `k` does not equal the previous key index `lk` or the timer `t` output `Q` is true, the key code transmission begins. First, the device code and selected key code are concatenated to form the transmission string `str`. The string is then converted into the network buffer content, and the buffer size `S_BUF.SIZE` is updated. Finally, the current key index `k` is assigned to the previous key index `lk`, and the timer is reset.\n\n  -- REGION Output Key Value\n     The current key index `k` is assigned to the output key value `KEY`, indicating the currently selected key code.\n\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK",

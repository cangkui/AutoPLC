{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `LIST_GET`, is designed to extract a substring from a specified position in a string list. The function splits the string list into multiple substrings using a delimiter (`SEP`) and returns the substring at the specified position (`POS`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `SEP` (delimiter) and `POS` (the position of the substring to extract).\n - Input/output variable: `LIST` (the string list, used for both input and output).\n - Local variables:\n   - `i`: An index for traversing the input string list, initialized to 1.\n   - `o`: An index for writing to the output string, initialized to 1.\n   - `pt`: A pointer to the input string list.\n   - `po`: A pointer to the output string.\n   - `cnt`: A counter for the number of delimiters found, initialized to 0.\n   - `c`: A temporary variable to store the current character.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- Pointer Initialization:\n    The function first sets the `pt` pointer to the input string list `LIST` and the `po` pointer to the output string `LIST_GET`.\n\n -- Traversing the Input String List:\n    A `REPEAT` loop is used to traverse the input string list `LIST` until the entire list is processed or a null terminator (`c = 0`) is encountered.\n\n -- Extracting the Specified Substring:\n    - If `cnt` equals `POS`, it means the current character is part of the target substring. If the current character `c` is the delimiter `SEP`, the loop exits. Otherwise, the character `c` is written to the output string `LIST_GET`, and the output index `o` is incremented.\n    - If the current character `c` is the delimiter `SEP`, the delimiter counter `cnt` is incremented.\n\n -- Terminating the Output String:\n    After the loop ends, a null terminator `0` is added to the end of the output string `LIST_GET` to mark the end of the string.\n\n -- Returning the Result:\n    The function returns `LIST_GET`, which is the extracted substring.\n\n- Summary\nThis function efficiently traverses the input string list, extracts the desired substring based on the delimiter and specified position, and returns it. It uses pointers for high-performance string access and manipulation, counting delimiters to locate the target substring. The final result is the extracted substring.", "name": "LIST_GET"}

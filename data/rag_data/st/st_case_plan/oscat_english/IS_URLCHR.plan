{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function named `IS_URLCHR`, designed to determine whether an input byte is a valid URL character. Valid URL characters include digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as certain special characters (such as `~`, `_`, `-`, `.`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BYTE`, representing the character to be evaluated.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of the function involves a series of conditional checks to determine if the input byte qualifies as a valid URL character. The specific logic is as follows:\n    1. Check if `IN` is a digit: `(IN > 47) AND (IN < 58)`, i.e., characters `0` to `9`.\n    2. Check if `IN` is an uppercase letter: `(IN > 64) AND (IN < 91)`, i.e., characters `A` to `Z`.\n    3. Check if `IN` is a lowercase letter: `(IN > 96) AND (IN < 123)`, i.e., characters `a` to `z`.\n    4. Check if `IN` is a special character: `(IN = 126)` (`~`), `(IN = 95)` (`_`), `(IN = 45)` (`-`), `(IN = 46)` (`.`).\n    If the input byte meets any of the above conditions, the function returns `TRUE`, indicating the character is a valid URL character; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.", "name": "IS_URLCHR"}

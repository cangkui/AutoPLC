{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function block named `GEN_PW2`, designed to generate a time-based pulse signal. The block dynamically adjusts the pulse's duty cycle and period based on input parameters (high-level duration `TH1`/`TH2` and low-level duration `TL1`/`TL2`) and a trigger signal `TS`. The output signal `Q` represents the current pulse state, while `TH` and `TL` indicate the current high-level and low-level durations, respectively.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `ENQ` (enable signal), `TH1` (high-level time 1), `TL1` (low-level time 1), `TH2` (high-level time 2), `TL2` (low-level time 2), `TS` (trigger signal for selecting time parameters).\n - Output variables: `Q` (pulse output signal), `TH` (current high-level time), `TL` (current low-level time).\n - Internal variables: `t_high` (current high-level time), `t_low` (current low-level time), `tx` (current time), `start` (timer start time), `init` (initialization flag), `et` (elapsed time).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   During the first run of the function block, the initialization flag `init` is set to `FALSE`, indicating initialization is required. During initialization, the current time `tx` is recorded as the timer start time `start`, and the output variables `TH` and `TL` are initialized to `T#0s`. After initialization, `init` is set to `TRUE` to prevent repeated initialization.\n\n-- REGION Time Parameter Selection\n   Based on the state of the input signal `TS`, either `TH1`/`TL1` or `TH2`/`TL2` is selected as the current high-level and low-level durations. If `TS` is `TRUE`, `TH2` and `TL2` are used; otherwise, `TH1` and `TL1` are used. The selected time parameters are assigned to `t_high` and `t_low`.\n\n-- REGION Pulse Generation\n   If the enable signal `ENQ` is `TRUE`, pulse generation begins. First, the elapsed time `et` from the timer start time `start` to the current time `tx` is calculated. Then, based on the current state of the output signal `Q`, the following processing occurs:\n   - If `Q` is `FALSE` (low-level state), check if `et` is greater than or equal to `t_low`. If true, set `Q` to `TRUE` (high-level state), reset the timer start time `start`, and set `TL` to `T#0s`. Otherwise, set `TL` to `et`, representing the current low-level duration.\n   - If `Q` is `TRUE` (high-level state), check if `et` is greater than or equal to `t_high`. If true, set `Q` to `FALSE` (low-level state), reset the timer start time `start`, and set `TH` to `T#0s`. Otherwise, set `TH` to `et`, representing the current high-level duration.\n   If the enable signal `ENQ` is `FALSE`, the output signal `Q` is set to `FALSE`, `TH` and `TL` are reset to `T#0s`, and the timer start time `start` is updated to the current time `tx`.", "name": "GEN_PW2"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block, named 'ESR_MON_X8', is used to monitor the status of 8 input signals and generate Event Status Records (ESR) based on these statuses. The main logic of the function block involves checking whether the input signals have changed and determining whether to log these changes into the ESR array based on the Mode setting. If a status change meets the conditions, the ESR_Flag is set to TRUE, indicating that a new status change requires processing.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input Variables: 8 input signals (s0-s7), date-time (DT_in), Mode, and 8 string addresses (a0-a7).\n - Output Variable: ESR_Flag, which signals whether there is a new status change.\n - Input/Output Variable: ESR_Out, a 4-element array used to store generated event status records.\n - Internal Variables: 8 internal state variables (x0-x7), a time variable (tx), and a counter (cnt).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This section initializes the function block's internal variables. First, the current time (in milliseconds) is converted to the TIME type and stored in the tx variable. Then, ESR_Flag is initialized to FALSE, and the type fields in the ESR_Out array are set to 0. Finally, the counter cnt is initialized to 0.\n\n-- REGION Status Monitoring and Processing\n   This section contains the core logic of the function block, which monitors input signal status changes and determines whether to generate event status records based on the Mode.\n   - For each input signal (s0-s7), the current value is first checked against the internal state variables (x0-x7). If they differ, the Mode condition is further evaluated:\n     - If the input signal value is less than 100, it satisfies all Modes (Mode >= 1).\n     - If the input signal value is between 100 and 199, it requires Mode >= 2.\n     - If the input signal value is greater than 199, it requires Mode = 3.\n   - If the conditions are met, the `status_to_ESR` function is called to generate an event status record, which is stored in the ESR_Out array. The internal state variable is then updated, and the counter cnt is incremented. If cnt is less than 4, the next input signal is processed.\n   - If any input signal status change is recorded, ESR_Flag is set to TRUE, indicating that a new status change requires processing.\n\n-- REGION End\n   This section marks the end of the function block. The main logic has been executed, and the function block awaits the next call.", "name": "ESR_MON_X8"}

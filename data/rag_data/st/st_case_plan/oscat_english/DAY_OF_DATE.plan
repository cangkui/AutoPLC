{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `DAY_OF_DATE`, is designed to extract the day component from an input date (of `DATE` type). It achieves this by converting the date into seconds and then dividing by the number of seconds in a day (86,400) to obtain the day count.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `idate`, of type `DATE`, representing the input date.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function involves converting the input `DATE` type data into `DWORD` type, then dividing it by the number of seconds in a day (86,400) to derive the day count. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. `DATE_TO_DWORD(idate)`: Converts the `DATE` type date into `DWORD` type seconds.\n    2. `DWORD_TO_DINT(...)`: Converts the `DWORD` type seconds into `DINT` type.\n    3. `/ 86400`: Divides the seconds by the number of seconds in a day (86,400) to obtain the day count.\n    4. Assigns the result to the function output `DAY_OF_DATE`, which represents the final day count.\n\n  Ultimately, the function returns the day count extracted from the date.", "name": "DAY_OF_DATE"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `FT_MIN_MAX`, designed to track the minimum and maximum values of input data. It supports resetting the min and max values via a reset signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` represents the input value, `rst` represents the reset signal.\n  - Output variables: `mx` indicates the current maximum value, `mn` indicates the current minimum value.\n  - Internal variable: `init` is used to mark whether initialization has been completed.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset Logic\n     - When the reset signal `rst` is true or `init` is false, the function block initializes the min and max values by setting both to the current input value `in`, and marks `init` as true. This indicates the function block has completed initialization.\n  \n  -- REGION Min and Max Update Logic\n     - If the input value `in` is less than the current minimum `mn`, the minimum `mn` is updated to the input value `in`.\n     - If the input value `in` is greater than the current maximum `mx`, the maximum `mx` is updated to the input value `in`.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this function block involves simple conditional checks to maintain the min and max values of the input. The reset signal can reset these values, causing them to restart tracking from the current input. This type of function block is commonly used in applications that require monitoring data ranges, such as tracking variations in sensor data."}

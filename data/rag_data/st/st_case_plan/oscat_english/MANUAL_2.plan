{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `MANUAL_2`, which controls the output signal `Q` and status `STATUS` based on input signals. The function block supports both manual and automatic modes, determining the output state according to the input signals `ON`, `OFF`, and `MAN`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `ENA` (enable signal), `ON` (turn-on signal), `OFF` (turn-off signal), `MAN` (manual signal).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output signal), `STATUS` (status signal, indicating the current operation state).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function block is a conditional structure that determines whether the block is enabled based on the value of the input signal `ENA`. If `ENA` is `TRUE`, the output `Q` and status `STATUS` are determined by the values of `ON`, `OFF`, and `MAN`:\n    - If both `ON` and `OFF` are `FALSE`, the output `Q` equals the input `IN`, and the status `STATUS` is `100`, indicating automatic mode.\n    - If `ON` is `TRUE` and `OFF` is `FALSE`, the output `Q` is `TRUE`, and the status `STATUS` is `101`, indicating forced-on mode.\n    - If `ON` is `FALSE` and `OFF` is `TRUE`, the output `Q` is `FALSE`, and the status `STATUS` is `102`, indicating forced-off mode.\n    - If both `ON` and `OFF` are `TRUE`, the output `Q` equals the manual signal `MAN`, and the status `STATUS` is `103`, indicating manual mode.\n    If `ENA` is `FALSE`, the output `Q` is `FALSE`, and the status `STATUS` is `104`, indicating the function block is disabled.", "name": "MANUAL_2"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `HEAT_TEMP` is used to calculate the heating temperature (`TY`) based on parameters such as external temperature, internal temperature, offset, etc., and determine whether to enable heating (`HEAT`). Through a series of calculations and conditional checks, the function block ensures the heating temperature stays within a reasonable range and adjusts it according to the required temperature (`T_REQ`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input Variables**: Include external temperature (`T_EXT`), internal temperature (`T_INT`), offset (`OFFSET`), required temperature (`T_REQ`), maximum heating temperature (`TY_MAX`), minimum heating temperature (`TY_MIN`), configured heating temperature (`TY_CONFIG`), configured internal temperature (`T_INT_CONFIG`), configured external temperature (`T_EXT_CONFIG`), temperature difference (`T_DIFF`), coefficient `C`, and coefficient `H`.\n  - **Output Variables**: Include the calculated heating temperature (`TY`) and heating status (`HEAT`).\n  - **Internal Variables**: Include intermediate calculated values `tr` and `tx`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Calculate Intermediate Values\n   - First, calculate `tr` using the formula: `tr := T_INT + OFFSET`, which represents the internal temperature plus the offset.\n   - Then, calculate `tx` using the formula: `tx := (tr - T_EXT) / (T_INT_CONFIG - T_EXT_CONFIG)`, representing the ratio of the adjusted temperature difference to the configured temperature difference.\n\n-- REGION Calculate Heating Temperature (`TY`)\n   - If the external temperature plus coefficient `H` is greater than `tr`, set `TY` directly to `0.0`, indicating no heating is needed.\n   - Otherwise, calculate `TY` using the following formula:\n     ```\n     TY := LIMIT(TY_MIN, tr + T_DIFF * 0.5 * tx + (TY_CONFIG - T_DIFF * 0.5 - tr) * EXPT(tx, 1.0 / C), TY_MAX)\n     ```\n     Here, the `LIMIT` function ensures `TY` stays between `TY_MIN` and `TY_MAX`, and the `EXPT` function calculates `tx` raised to the power of `1.0 / C`.\n   - Finally, compare `TY` with the required temperature `T_REQ` and take the higher value to ensure the heating temperature meets the demand.\n\n-- REGION Determine Heating Status (`HEAT`)\n   - If `TY` is greater than `0.0`, set `HEAT` to `TRUE`, indicating heating is required; otherwise, set it to `FALSE`.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block dynamically adjusts the heating temperature and decides whether to enable heating through a series of calculations and conditional checks. Its core logic includes:\n  - Calculating intermediate values `tr` and `tx` based on internal temperature, external temperature, and offset.\n  - Using a formula to compute the heating temperature and ensuring it stays within reasonable bounds via the `LIMIT` function.\n  - Further adjusting the heating temperature based on the required temperature `T_REQ`.\n  - Determining whether to enable heating based on the final heating temperature.", "name": "HEAT_TEMP"}

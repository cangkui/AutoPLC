{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block is named 'FUNCTION OVERRIDE : REAL'. It selects and outputs a real value based on input conditions and the absolute values of the input values. Its logic determines the final output value (OVERRIDE) by evaluating enable signals (E1, E2, E3) and the absolute magnitudes of input values (X1, X2, X3).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - X1, X2, X3: Three real values serving as potential output candidates.\n    - E1, E2, E3: Three Boolean values acting as enable signals, deciding whether to consider their corresponding input values.\n  - Output Variable:\n    - OVERRIDE: The final output value, of type REAL.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The function block's logic is divided into three parts, each corresponding to an input value and its enable signal:\n    1. If E1 is true, set OVERRIDE to X1.\n    2. If E2 is true and the absolute value of X2 is greater than the current absolute value of OVERRIDE, set OVERRIDE to X2.\n    3. If E3 is true and the absolute value of X3 is greater than the current absolute value of OVERRIDE, set OVERRIDE to X3.\n    The logic executes sequentially from top to bottom, establishing a priority order of E1 > E2 > E3. If E1 is true, OVERRIDE is directly set to X1 without considering E2 or E3. If E1 is false, the conditions for E2 and E3 are then evaluated.\n\n- Output Result\n  The final output value (OVERRIDE) is determined by the input conditions and the absolute magnitudes of the input values. It could be one of X1, X2, or X3, depending on the enable signals and the absolute values of the inputs.", "name": "OVERRIDE"}

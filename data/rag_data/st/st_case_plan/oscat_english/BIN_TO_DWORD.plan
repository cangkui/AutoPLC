{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `BIN_TO_DWORD` converts a binary string into a numerical value of type `DWORD`. It achieves this by iterating through each character in the string and constructing the `DWORD` value bit by bit, depending on whether the character is `'0'` or `'1'`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `BIN`: A string of length 40 representing a binary number.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the current character in the string.\n    - `i`: An index variable used for looping.\n    - `X`: A temporary variable to store the current character.\n    - `stop`: The length of the string, used to control loop iterations.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the pointer `pt` is set to the starting address of the input string `BIN`, and the string length `stop` is calculated to control the loop iterations.\n  -- REGION Loop Processing\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string:\n    - The current character's value is stored in variable `X`.\n    - If `X` is `'0'` (ASCII value 48), `BIN_TO_DWORD` is left-shifted by one bit (equivalent to multiplying by 2).\n    - If `X` is `'1'` (ASCII value 49), `BIN_TO_DWORD` is left-shifted by one bit, and the least significant bit is set to 1.\n    - The pointer `pt` is then moved to the next character's position.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    After the loop completes, the function returns the constructed `DWORD` value.\n\n  The core idea of this function is to process the binary string bit by bit, converting it into a `DWORD` numerical value. Left-shift operations are used to build the value bit by bit, while the `OR 1` operation sets the least significant bit to 1.", "name": "BIN_TO_DWORD"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'TEMP_EXT', designed to control heating and cooling systems based on external temperature values. The function block determines whether to activate heating or cooling based on input temperature values, date, time, and configuration parameters. It also considers seasonal cycles for heating and cooling, as well as different temperature settings for day and night.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: External temperature values (t_ext1, t_ext2, t_ext3), temperature configuration (t_ext_config), date and time (dt_in), temperature range (t_ext_min, t_ext_max), default temperature (t_ext_default), heating and cooling cycles (heat_period_start, heat_period_stop, cool_period_start, cool_period_stop), heating and cooling start/stop temperatures (heat_start_temp_day, heat_start_temp_night, heat_stop_temp, cool_start_temp_day, cool_start_temp_night, cool_stop_temp), day and night start times (start_day, start_night), cycle time (CYCLE_TIME).\n - Output variables: Final external temperature (t_ext), heating status (heat), cooling status (cool).\n - Internal variables: Time variables (tx, last_run), initialization flag (init), heating and cooling cycle dates (cool_start, cool_stop, heat_start, heat_stop), current date (xdate), day flag (day).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This region initializes the function block. If the block hasn't been initialized, it sets the start and end dates for heating and cooling cycles. These dates are based on input parameters, but the year is fixed to 1972 to ensure consistent annual cycles.\n-- REGION Time Check\n   This region checks if the cycle time has been reached. If not, it returns immediately without executing further logic, ensuring the block runs at specified intervals.\n-- REGION Date and Time Processing\n   This region processes the current date and time. It converts the input date and time into the format used by the function block and determines whether it is currently day or night.\n-- REGION Temperature Processing\n   This region calculates the final external temperature based on input temperature values and configuration parameters. It uses the 'MULTI_IN' function to select a valid temperature from multiple input values and ensures it falls within the specified range.\n-- REGION Heating Control\n   This region decides whether to activate heating based on the current date, time, and external temperature. If the current date is within the heating cycle and the temperature is below the set start temperature, heating is activated. If the temperature exceeds the stop temperature, heating is deactivated.\n-- REGION Cooling Control\n   This region decides whether to activate cooling based on the current date, time, and external temperature. If the current date is within the cooling cycle and the temperature is above the set start temperature, cooling is activated. If the temperature drops below the stop temperature, cooling is deactivated.\n-- REGION Time Update\n   This region updates the last run time to facilitate checks in the next cycle.", "name": "TEMP_EXT"}

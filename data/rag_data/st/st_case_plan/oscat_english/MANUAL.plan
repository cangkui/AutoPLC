{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple Boolean function named `FUNCTION MANUAL`, which calculates the output `MANUAL` based on the input signals `IN`, `ON`, and `OFF`. The logic of the function is as follows: when the `OFF` signal is false and either `IN` or `ON` is true, the output `MANUAL` is true; otherwise, the output is false.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN`, `ON`, `OFF`, all of Boolean type.\n - Output variable: `MANUAL`, Boolean type, representing the computed result of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   The function's logic is very simple and is implemented with the following Boolean expression:\n   ```\n   MANUAL := NOT OFF AND (IN OR ON);\n   ```\n   Explanation:\n   - `NOT OFF`: When `OFF` is false, `NOT OFF` is true.\n   - `IN OR ON`: When at least one of `IN` or `ON` is true, `IN OR ON` is true.\n   - `NOT OFF AND (IN OR ON)`: When `OFF` is false and either `IN` or `ON` is true, the result is true.\n   Ultimately, the value of `MANUAL` is determined by this expression.\n\n-- REGION End\n   After the function completes execution, it returns the value of `MANUAL`.", "name": "MANUAL"}

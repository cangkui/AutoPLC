{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements an 8-bit right-shift register function block (SHR_8UDE). It controls the state of 8 output bits (Q0-Q7) based on input signals (SET, RST, CLK, DN). The shift operation is triggered by the rising edge of the CLK signal, the DN signal determines the shift direction (right or left), and the SET and RST signals are used to initialize the output state.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: SET (set), D0 (data input bit 0), D7 (data input bit 7), CLK (clock), DN (shift direction), RST (reset).\n  - Output variables: Q0-Q7 (8-bit output).\n  - Internal variables: trig (rising-edge trigger, used to detect the rising edge of the CLK signal).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset Logic:\n     - If the SET or RST signal is true, the output bits are initialized. If RST is true, all output bits (Q0-Q7) are cleared (i.e., set to false). If SET is true, all output bits are set to the value of D0.\n  \n  -- REGION Shift Logic:\n     - If a rising edge of the CLK signal is detected (via the trig trigger), a shift operation is performed:\n       - If DN is true, a right shift is executed: Q0-Q7 are shifted right by one bit, and the value of Q7 is provided by input D7.\n       - If DN is false, a left shift is executed: Q0-Q7 are shifted left by one bit, and the value of Q0 is provided by input D0.\n  \n  -- REGION Output Update:\n     - After the shift operation is completed, the values of the output bits (Q0-Q7) are updated.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block triggers a shift operation on the rising edge of the CLK signal, with the DN signal controlling the shift direction, and the SET and RST signals used to initialize the output state. It is a typical 8-bit shift register suitable for applications requiring bit manipulation.", "name": "SHR_8UDE"}

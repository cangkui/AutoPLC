{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `FIND_CTRL` is used to search for control characters (characters with ASCII values less than 32 or equal to 127) in a given string and returns their positions. If no control characters are found, it returns 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `str` is the string to be searched, `pos` is the starting position for the search.\n - Internal variables: `i` is the loop counter, `pt` is a pointer to the string's byte array, `stop` is the length of the string, `x` is the ASCII value of the current character.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Initialization\n    First, assign the string's address to the pointer `pt` and calculate the string's length, storing it in `stop`.\n -- REGION Loop Search\n    Use a `FOR` loop to iterate from `MAX(pos, 1)` to `stop`. In each iteration, access the ASCII value of the current character via the pointer `pt` and assign it to `x`.\n    If `x` is a control character (ASCII value less than 32 or equal to 127), return the current character's position `i` and exit the function.\n -- REGION No Control Characters Found\n    If the loop completes without finding any control characters, return 0.", "name": "FIND_CTRL"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block named `SIGNAL` is used to generate an output signal `Q` based on the input signal `IN`, signal mode `SIG`, and time interval `TS`. Its core logic involves calculating a step value through time and determining the state of the output signal based on the step value and signal mode.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` (Boolean, trigger signal), `SIG` (byte value, signal mode), `TS` (time value, time interval).\n - Output variable: `Q` (Boolean, output signal).\n - Internal variables: `tx` (double word value, current timestamp), `step` (byte value, step value).\n - Constant: `one` (byte value, fixed as 1).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   1. **Trigger Signal Detection**:\n      - If `IN` is true, execute the logic; otherwise, set the output `Q` to false.\n   2. **Get Current Timestamp**:\n      - Use `T_PLC_MS()` to retrieve the current timestamp and store it in `tx`.\n   3. **Calculate Step Value**:\n      - If `TS` is greater than 0 seconds, divide `tx` by `TS` and take the lower 3 bits (`AND 16#0000_0007`) to obtain the step value.\n      - If `TS` is 0 seconds, right-shift `tx` by 7 bits and take the lower 3 bits (`AND 16#0000_0007`) to obtain the step value.\n   4. **Generate Step Mask**:\n      - Left-shift the constant `one` by `step` bits to generate the step mask.\n   5. **Determine Output Signal**:\n      - Perform a bitwise AND operation between the step mask and signal mode `SIG`. If the result is greater than 0, set the output `Q` to true; otherwise, set it to false.\n-- REGION End", "name": "SIGNAL"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a functional block named 'DIMM_2' designed to control a dimming device. It supports multiple operation modes, including set, reset, single click, long press, double click, etc. The block also features soft dimming and a maximum on-time limit.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: SET, VAL, I1, I2, RST, T_DEBOUNCE, T_ON_MAX, T_DIMM_START, T_DIMM, MIN_ON, MAX_ON, RST_OUT, SOFT_DIMM, DBL1_TOG, DBL2_TOG, DBL1_SET, DBL2_SET, DBL1_POS, DBL2_POS\n  - Output variables: Q, D1, D2\n  - Input/output variable: OUT\n  - Internal variables: t1 (debounce timer 1), t2 (debounce timer 2), dc1 (click mode 1), dc2 (click mode 2), t3 (max on-time timer), dim (dimming controller)\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Debounce Handling\n     Two debounce timers (t1 and t2) are used to filter input signals I1 and I2, respectively. The debounce time is determined by the input parameter T_DEBOUNCE. The debounced signals are then used for click mode detection (dc1 and dc2).\n  \n  -- REGION Reset Handling\n     If the reset signal RST is true, the output value OUT is cleared based on RST_OUT's value. Additionally, outputs Q, D1, and D2 are set to false.\n\n  -- REGION Set Handling\n     If the set signal SET is true, the output value OUT is updated to the input value VAL, and output Q is set to true.\n\n  -- REGION Single Click Handling\n     If a single click (SINGLE) is detected on dc1, the output value OUT is clamped between MIN_ON and MAX_ON, and output Q is set to true. If a single click is detected on dc2, output Q is set to false.\n\n  -- REGION Long Press Handling\n     If a long press (TP_LONG) is detected on dc1, the output value OUT is constrained between MIN_ON and MAX_ON (depending on SOFT_DIMM), and output Q is set to true. The dimming controller 'dim' is also set to true (dimming mode). If a long press is detected on dc2, 'dim' is set to false (brightening mode).\n\n  -- REGION Double Click Handling\n     If a double click (DOUBLE) is detected on dc1, the output value OUT is either set to DBL1_POS (if DBL1_SET is true) or toggles output D1. Similarly, if a double click is detected on dc2, OUT is set to DBL2_POS (if DBL2_SET is true) or toggles output D2. If DBL1_TOG or DBL2_TOG is false, the corresponding output (D1 or D2) is set to false.\n\n  -- REGION Dimming Handling\n     The dimming controller 'dim' adjusts the output value OUT based on long press signals from dc1 and dc2. The dimming duration is determined by the input parameter T_DIMM.\n\n  -- REGION Output Value Handling\n     If the output value OUT is 0, output Q is set to false.\n\n  -- REGION Maximum On-Time Handling\n     If the input parameter T_ON_MAX is greater than 0, the maximum on-time timer t3 limits the duration for which output Q remains active. Once the timer expires, output Q is toggled.", "name": "DIMM_2"}

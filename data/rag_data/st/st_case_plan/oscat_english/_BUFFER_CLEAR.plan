{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `_BUFFER_CLEAR`, designed to clear a section of memory buffer. It zeroes out the specified memory region either byte-by-byte or in double-word (DWORD) chunks. This functionality is useful for scenarios requiring memory initialization.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input Variables:\n   - `PT`: A pointer of type BYTE, representing the starting address of the buffer.\n   - `SIZE`: A variable of type UINT, indicating the size of the buffer (in bytes) to be cleared.\n - Internal Variables:\n   - `ptw`: A pointer of type DWORD, used for double-word clearing operations.\n   - `temp`: A variable of type DWORD, used for temporarily storing pointer addresses and calculations.\n   - `end`: A variable of type DWORD, representing the end address of the buffer.\n   - `end32`: A variable of type DWORD, indicating the address of the last complete double-word in the buffer.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION: Byte-by-Byte Clearing (Alignment Handling):\n   First, the input pointer `PT` is assigned to the temporary variable `temp`, and the end address `end` of the buffer is calculated. Then, `end32` is computed to mark the address of the last complete double-word in the buffer. A `WHILE` loop is used to clear memory byte-by-byte until the pointer address aligns to a double-word boundary (i.e., the lowest two bits of the address are 0). After each clearing operation, both the pointer `PT` and the temporary variable `temp` are incremented by 1.\n\n-- REGION: Double-Word Clearing:\n   The pointer `PT` is assigned to `ptw`, and a `WHILE` loop is used to clear memory in double-word chunks. After each operation, the pointer `ptw` is incremented by 4 (pointing to the next double-word address). The loop condition ensures that only complete double-word regions are processed by checking if `ptw` is less than `end32`.\n\n-- REGION: Byte-by-Byte Clearing (Remaining Portion):\n   The pointer `ptw` is reassigned back to `PT`, and another `WHILE` loop clears the remaining unaligned portion of the buffer (i.e., the end section that doesn't fit into a complete double-word). After each operation, the pointer `PT` is incremented by 1.\n\n-- REGION: Return Result:\n   Finally, the function return value `_BUFFER_CLEAR` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the successful completion of the buffer clearing operation.\n\n- Summary\nThis function efficiently clears the buffer by combining byte-by-byte and double-word clearing methods while addressing memory alignment issues. Double-word clearing significantly improves performance, while byte-by-byte clearing ensures proper handling of unaligned sections. The function returns `TRUE` upon successful execution.", "name": "_BUFFER_CLEAR"}

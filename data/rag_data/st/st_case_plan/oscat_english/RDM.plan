Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `RDM` that generates a pseudo-random real number based on the input value `last`. The function manipulates the current system time (in milliseconds) along with other bitwise operations to generate the random number, which is then mapped to a real number within the `[0, 1]` range.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `last`, a real number used to constrain the range of the random number.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `tn`, a DWORD-type variable used to store and manipulate the time value.\n    - `tc`, an INT-type variable used to store the bit count of `tn`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Time Retrieval and Bit Manipulation:\n     - `tn := T_PLC_MS();`  \n       Retrieves the current PLC system time (in milliseconds) and stores it in `tn`.\n     - `tc := BIT_COUNT(tn);`  \n       Counts the number of binary '1's in `tn` and stores the result in `tc`.\n     - Rearranges the bits of `tn`:\n       ```plaintext\n       tn.31 := tn.2;\n       tn.30 := tn.5;\n       tn.29 := tn.4;\n       tn.28 := tn.1;\n       tn.27 := tn.0;\n       tn.26 := tn.7;\n       tn.25 := tn.6;\n       tn.24 := tn.3;\n       ```\n       These operations shuffle certain bits of `tn` to enhance randomness.\n     - `tn := ROL(tn, BIT_COUNT(tn)) OR 16#80000001;`  \n       Performs a circular left shift (ROL) on `tn` by the number of bits counted, then applies a bitwise OR with the constant `16#80000001` to further increase randomness.\n     - `tn := tn MOD 71474513 + INT_TO_DWORD(tc + 77);`  \n       Applies a modulo operation (with modulus 71474513) to `tn`, then adds `tc + 77` to generate a new `tn` value.\n\n  -- REGION Random Number Generation and Mapping:\n     - `RDM := FRACT(DWORD_TO_REAL(tn) / 10000000.0 * (math.E - LIMIT(0.0, last, 1.0)));`  \n       Converts `tn` to a real number, divides it by 10000000.0, then multiplies by `(math.E - LIMIT(0.0, last, 1.0))`. `LIMIT(0.0, last, 1.0)` constrains `last` within the `[0, 1]` range. `math.E` is the natural constant e (~2.71828). The `FRACT` function extracts the fractional part of the result to produce the final random number `RDM`.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a pseudo-random real number within the `[0, 1]` range, derived from the input `last` and the current system time.", "name": "RDM"}

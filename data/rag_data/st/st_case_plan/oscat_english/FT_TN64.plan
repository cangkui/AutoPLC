{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function block written in SCL, named 'FT_TN64', designed to implement a simple sliding window filter. The function block takes a real number input and a time parameter, then outputs the filtered result and a trigger signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Input value (`in`) and time parameter (`T`).\n  - Output variables: Output value (`out`) and trigger signal (`trig`).\n  - Internal variables: Window length (`length`), an array to store input values (`X`), a counter (`cnt`), the last update time (`last`), current time (`tx`), and an initialization flag (`init`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, the current time is retrieved and stored in the variable `tx`. The trigger signal `trig` is initialized to `FALSE`. If the function block is not initialized (`init` is `FALSE`), the input value `in` is stored in the current position of the array `X`, the initialization flag `init` is set to `TRUE`, and the current time `last` is recorded.\n  \n  -- REGION Sliding Window Update\n     If the difference between the current time `tx` and the last update time `last` is greater than or equal to the time parameter `T` divided by the window length `length`, the following operations are performed:\n     1. Update the counter `cnt`: If `cnt` has reached the window length minus 1, it is reset to 0; otherwise, it is incremented by 1.\n     2. Assign the value at position `cnt` in the array `X` to the output `out`.\n     3. Store the current input value `in` at position `cnt` in the array `X`.\n     4. Update the last update time `last` to the current time `tx`.\n     5. Set the trigger signal `trig` to `TRUE`, indicating that the output has been updated.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements a sliding window filter by maintaining a fixed-length array. Each time the input value is updated, the output value is updated based on the time parameter `T` and the window length `length`, and a corresponding signal is triggered. This type of filter can be used to smooth input signals or extract certain features of the signal.", "name": "FT_TN64"}

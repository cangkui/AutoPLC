{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block `DLOG_FILE_TO_FTP` is used to upload log files to a remote server via the FTP protocol. It handles file reading, FTP transfer, error handling, and retry mechanisms.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output variables: `X`, used to pass log file data.\n - Input variables: FTP server URL, activation signal, file deletion flag, timeout duration, retry count, retry interval time, DNS and PLC IP addresses.\n - Output variables: Transfer completion flag, busy flag, error code, and error type.\n - Internal variables: Includes ring buffer data, ring buffer, FTP client instance, timers, trigger flag, filename, step counter, FTP busy flag, FTP completion flag, and retry counter.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION File Trigger Handling\n   This section processes the trigger signal for new files. When `X.NEW_FILE_RTRIG` is true and `ftrig_old` is false, it indicates a new file needs processing. At this point, the ring buffer data `UCBD` is initialized, `D_HEAD` and `D_MODE` are set, and the new filename `X.NEW_FILE` is stored in `UCBD.D_STRING`. The `UCB` function block is then called to write the data to the ring buffer. Finally, `ftrig_old` is updated to the current value of `X.NEW_FILE_RTRIG` for edge detection.\n\n-- REGION Step Control\n   The function block uses the `step` variable to control different processing steps, implementing a state machine logic:\n   - Step 00: Checks if there are pending files in the ring buffer. If `UCBD.BUF_COUNT` is greater than 0 and `ftp_busy` is false, it means a file needs transferring. Here, `UCBD.D_MODE` is set to 12, the `UCB` function block is called to read the filename from the buffer and store it in the `filename` variable. The retry counter `cnt` is initialized to the `RETRY` value, and the process moves to step 10.\n   - Step 10: Checks if the FTP client is idle. If `ftp_busy` is false, the FTP client can start transferring. If `ftp_done` is true, the transfer is complete, and the process returns to step 00 to handle the next file. Otherwise, it proceeds to step 20 to begin the transfer.\n   - Step 20: Waits for the retry interval. The timer `WT_1` is started in this step. When the timer reaches the specified `RETRY_TIME`, the following logic is executed:\n     - Decrements the retry counter `cnt`.\n     - If `RETRY` is 0, no retries are performed, and the process returns to step 10.\n     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0, retries are still available, and the process returns to step 10 to retry the transfer.\n     - If `cnt` is less than 0, retries are exhausted, and the process returns to step 00 to handle the next file.\n\n-- REGION FTP Transfer\n   In steps 10 and 20, the FTP client is activated to begin file transfer. The `FTP_CLIENT` function block is called with the following parameters:\n   - `ACTIVATE`: Set to `BUSY`, indicating the transfer is in progress.\n   - `FILENAME`: Set to the filename `filename` read from the ring buffer.\n   - `FTP_URL`: Set to the input FTP server URL.\n   - `FTP_DOWNLOAD`: Set to `FALSE`, indicating a file upload.\n   - `FTP_ACTIV`: Set to the input `FTP_ACTIV`, indicating whether the FTP client is active.\n   - `FILE_DELETE`: Set to the input `FILE_DELETE`, indicating whether to delete the file after transfer.\n   - `TIMEOUT`: Set to the input `TIMEOUT`, specifying the transfer timeout duration.\n   - `DNS_IP4` and `PLC_IP4`: Set to the input DNS and PLC IP addresses.\n   - `DONE` and `BUSY`: Output to `ftp_done` and `ftp_busy`, indicating transfer completion and progress.\n\n-- REGION Error Handling\n   The function block checks for the following error conditions and updates the output variables `ERROR_C` and `ERROR_T`:\n   - If `FTP_CLIENT.ERROR_T` is not 0, an FTP client error has occurred, and `FTP_CLIENT.ERROR_C` and `FTP_CLIENT.ERROR_T` are output to `ERROR_C` and `ERROR_T`.\n   - If `UCBD.BUF_DATA_LOST` is greater than 0, ring buffer data loss is detected, and `ERROR_C` is set to `DWORD#2`, `ERROR_T` to `BYTE#6`.\n   - If `UCBD.BUF_USED_MAX` exceeds `USINT#90`, ring buffer usage is too high, and `ERROR_C` is set to `DWORD#1`, `ERROR_T` to `BYTE#6`.\n   - If no errors occur, `ERROR_C` and `ERROR_T` are set to `DWORD#0` and `BYTE#0`.\n\n-- REGION Timer Control\n   The timer `WT_1` controls the retry interval. When the step is 20, the timer starts and waits for the specified `RETRY_TIME`. The timer's `IN` parameter is set to `step = 20`, meaning it activates during step 20. When the timer expires, `WT_1.Q` becomes true, triggering the retry logic.\n\n-- REGION Output Update\n   Based on the current step and error status, the output variables are updated:\n   - `BUSY`: Set to `step = 10`, indicating the function block is processing a file transfer.\n   - `DONE`: Set to `step = 0`, indicating the function block has completed the transfer.\n   - `ERROR_C` and `ERROR_T`: Updated according to error handling logic, representing the error code and type.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block controls the file transfer process via a state machine, supporting retry mechanisms and error handling to ensure successful uploads to the FTP server. Each step has clear logic and processing flow, ensuring stability and reliability.", "name": "DLOG_FILE_TO_FTP"}

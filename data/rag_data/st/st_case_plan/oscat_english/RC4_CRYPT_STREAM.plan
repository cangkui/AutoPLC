{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function block named 'RC4_CRYPT_STREAM' for performing the RC4 stream encryption algorithm. RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that generates a pseudorandom stream to encrypt data. The function block supports two modes: initialization mode and encryption mode.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: MODE (mode), KEY (encryption key), BUF (buffer), SIZE (data size), POS (current position)\n - Internal Variables: sbox (S-box), skey (key array), a, b, c, d, e (loop counters), end (end position), v (temporary variable)\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Mode 1: Initialization\n   This mode initializes the S-box and key array for the RC4 algorithm. First, it checks whether the key length and data size are valid. If invalid, it sets the mode to 3 (end) and returns. Otherwise, it initializes the skey array using the key and sets the sbox array to values from 0 to 255. Then, it mixes the sbox and skey arrays through loops to generate the final S-box. Finally, it sets POS to 0, calculates the end position, and switches the mode to 2 (encryption).\n\n-- REGION Mode 2: Encryption\n   This mode performs the actual encryption. First, it calculates the range of data to be encrypted. Then, it generates a pseudorandom stream through loops and XORs it with the data in the buffer to produce the encrypted data. After each encryption, it updates the POS and SIZE values. If SIZE becomes 0, it means all data has been encrypted, and the mode is set to 3 (end).\n\n-- REGION Mode 3: End\n   This mode indicates the completion of the encryption process. Although the code does not explicitly handle logic for mode 3, typically in this mode, the function block may perform cleanup operations or wait for new encryption tasks.\n\n- Summary\nThis code implements the RC4 stream encryption algorithm using a state machine approach. In mode 1, it initializes the S-box and key array; in mode 2, it performs encryption; and in mode 3, it concludes the process. The code is well-structured, logically sound, and efficiently handles data encryption tasks.", "name": "RC4_CRYPT_STREAM"}

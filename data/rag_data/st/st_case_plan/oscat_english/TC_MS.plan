Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'TC_MS', designed to calculate the time difference between two points in time (in milliseconds). It achieves this by obtaining the current system time and calculating the difference from the previously recorded time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Output variable: TC, representing the time difference (in milliseconds).\n - Internal variables: init (initialization flag), tx (current time), last (last recorded time).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization and Time Difference Calculation\n   1. **Get Current Time**: First, the current system time (in milliseconds) is obtained by calling the `T_PLC_MS()` function and stored in the variable `tx`.\n   2. **Initialization Check**: If `init` is `FALSE`, it indicates the function block is running for the first time. In this case, `init` is set to `TRUE`, and the output variable `TC` is initialized to `0` since no time difference can be calculated yet.\n   3. **Time Difference Calculation**: If `init` is `TRUE`, it means the function block has been initialized. The difference between the current time `tx` and the last recorded time `last` is calculated, and the result is assigned to the output variable `TC`.\n   4. **Update Last Recorded Time**: Regardless of initialization, the current time `tx` is always assigned to `last` so it can be used to calculate the time difference in the next cycle.", "name": "TC_MS"}

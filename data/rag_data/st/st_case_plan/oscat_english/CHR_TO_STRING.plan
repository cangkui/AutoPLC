{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CHR_TO_STRING`, which converts a character of type `BYTE` into a string of type `STRING`. The function uses pointer operations to write the input character into the first position of the string and appends a null terminator `0` afterward.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input variable: `C`, of type `BYTE`, represents the character to be converted.\n  - Internal variable: `PT`, of type `POINTER TO BYTE`, is used to point to the starting address of the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Character Conversion Logic\n    1. **Pointer Initialization**: `PT` is initialized to point to the starting address of the function's return value `CHR_TO_STRING`. It is assumed here that `CHR_TO_STRING` is a string variable, with its first byte reserved for storing the character.\n    2. **Write Character**: The input character `C` is written to the address pointed to by `PT` (i.e., the first byte of the string).\n    3. **Move Pointer**: The `PT` pointer is advanced to the next byte position.\n    4. **Write Null Terminator**: A `0` is written to the address pointed to by `PT`, serving as the string's null terminator.\n    5. **Return Result**: The function returns `CHR_TO_STRING`, which is now a string containing the input character and the null terminator.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently converts a single-byte character into a string by using pointer operations and appends a null terminator `0` to ensure proper string termination. The implementation is straightforward and performant, but it requires that `CHR_TO_STRING` is a sufficiently large string variable to prevent memory boundary issues.", "name": "CHR_TO_STRING"}

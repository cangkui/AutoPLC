{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `CAPITALIZE`, and its purpose is to capitalize the first letter of each word in the input string while keeping the rest of the letters unchanged. The function achieves this by iterating through each character in the string and converting the next character to uppercase whenever a space is detected.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the input string.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `PT`: A pointer to the current character in the string.\n    - `pos`: An index used to traverse the string.\n    - `L`: Stores the length of the string.\n    - `first`: A boolean variable that marks whether the current character is the first letter of a word.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    - First, the function output `CAPITALIZE` is initialized to the input string `str`.\n    - The `LEN` function is used to get the length of the string, which is stored in the variable `L`.\n    - The pointer `PT` is initialized to point to the address of the function output `CAPITALIZE`.\n\n  -- REGION String Traversal\n    - A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string, from the 1st character to the `L`th character.\n    - Within the loop, the `first` variable is checked. If it is `TRUE`, the current character is converted to uppercase, and the `first` variable is updated to `FALSE`.\n    - The current character is checked to see if it is a space (ASCII code 32). If so, the `first` variable is set to `TRUE`, indicating that the next character is the first letter of a new word.\n    - The pointer `PT` is moved to the next character's position.\n\n  -- REGION Completion\n    - After the loop ends, the function output `CAPITALIZE` will be the string with the first letter of each word capitalized.", "name": "CAPITALIZE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function named `V3_PAR` is used to determine whether two 3D vectors are parallel. It checks if the absolute value of the cross product of the two vectors is zero to determine their parallelism.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `A` and `B`, representing the two 3D vectors.\n - Output variable: `V3_PAR`, a Boolean value indicating whether the two vectors are parallel.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function is as follows:\n 1. First, compute the cross product of the input vectors `A` and `B` using the `V3_XPRO` function.\n 2. Then, calculate the absolute value (magnitude) of the cross product using the `V3_ABS` function.\n 3. Finally, check if this absolute value equals 0.0. If it does, the vectors are parallel, and the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Detailed Explanation\n - **Cross Product Calculation**: `V3_XPRO(A, B)` computes the cross product of the two vectors. The result is a new vector perpendicular to the plane formed by `A` and `B`, with a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of `A` and `B` and the sine of the angle between them.\n - **Absolute Value Calculation**: The `V3_ABS` function calculates the magnitude (length) of the vector. If the two vectors are parallel, their cross product is a zero vector, and its magnitude is 0.0.\n - **Parallelism Check**: By checking if the magnitude of the cross product is zero, the function determines if the vectors are parallel. A zero magnitude means the vectors are parallel; otherwise, they are not.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a Boolean value indicating whether the two input vectors are parallel. If they are parallel, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.", "name": "V3_PAR"}

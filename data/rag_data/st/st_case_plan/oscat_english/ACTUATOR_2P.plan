{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'ACTUATOR_2P', designed to control a two-position actuator. It generates output signals based on input signals and sensor signals, and supports self-activation functionality.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: IN (input signal), TEST (test mode), ARE (self-activation enable), CYCLE_TIME (cycle time), SENS (sensor signal), SELF_ACT_TIME (self-activation time), SELF_ACT_PULSE (self-activation pulse width), SELF_ACT_CYCLES (self-activation cycle count)\n - Input/output variables: ARX (self-activation request signal)\n - Output variables: OUT (output signal), ARO (self-activation output signal)\n - Internal variables: timer (self-activation timer), pwgen (pulse generator)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Self-Activation Control\n   This section handles the self-activation logic. First, the timer 'timer' is used to control the self-activation process. The timer's run time (trun) is the self-activation pulse width multiplied by twice the self-activation cycle count, and the off time (toff) is the self-activation time. The timer's test mode and self-activation enable are controlled by input variables. The self-activation output signal 'ARO' is determined by the timer's output.\n\n-- REGION Output Control\n   This section generates the output signal based on the self-activation status and input signals. If the self-activation output signal 'ARO' is true, the pulse generator 'pwgen' is used to generate a fixed-width pulse, and the output signal 'OUT' is set to the pulse generator's output. If the input signal 'IN' is less than the sensor signal 'SENS', the output signal 'OUT' is set to false. If the input signal 'IN' is greater than 255 minus the sensor signal 'SENS', the output signal 'OUT' is set to true. Otherwise, the pulse generator's high-level time (PTH) and low-level time (PTL) are calculated based on the input signal and sensor signal, and the corresponding pulse is generated, with the output signal 'OUT' set to the pulse generator's output.", "name": "ACTUATOR_2P"}

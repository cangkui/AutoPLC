{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named 'YAHOO_WEATHER_DESC_GE', is designed to convert weather codes from Yahoo weather data into corresponding weather description texts. When the activation signal is true, the function block iterates through multiple fields in the weather data, converting each field's code into the appropriate descriptive text.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: YW, of type YAHOO_WEATHER_DATA, used to store weather data.\n  - Input Variables: ACTIVATE, of type BOOL, used to activate the function block's logic.\n  - Internal Variables: act_last, of type BOOL, stores the activation state from the previous cycle; x, of type INT, temporarily stores weather codes; y, of type INT, serves as a loop counter; str, of type STRING[40], stores the weather description text.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Activation Detection and Processing\n     This region handles the activation logic of the function block. First, it checks if the current activation signal is true and the previous cycle's activation signal was false. If so, it enters a loop to iterate through 12 different weather data fields. Each field's weather code is stored in variable x, then converted into the corresponding weather description text via a CASE statement and stored in variable str. Finally, the value of str is assigned to the respective weather data field. After the loop completes, the current activation signal's value is stored in the act_last variable for comparison in the next cycle.\n     - The CASE statement within the loop converts weather codes into description texts. For example, code 00 corresponds to 'Wirbelsturm' (hurricane), code 01 to 'Tropensturm' (tropical storm), and so on. If a code is not within the known range, 'nicht verf√ºgbar' (not available) is used as the default description.\n  -- REGION State Update\n     This region updates the act_last variable's value to detect changes in the activation signal in the next cycle.", "name": "YAHOO_WEATHER_DESC_GE"}

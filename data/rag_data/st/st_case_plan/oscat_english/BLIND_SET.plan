{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `BLIND_SET`, is designed to control the raising and lowering operations of blinds. It handles both manual and automatic control modes and supports position recovery functionality. The block uses input signals to manage blind movement and outputs the current state and position information.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `UP` (raise signal), `DN` (lower signal), `S_IN` (state input), `PI` (position input), `AI` (angle input), `IN` (enable signal), `PX` (position override), `AX` (angle override), `OVERRIDE_MANUAL` (manual override), `RESTORE_POSITION` (restore position), `RESTORE_TIME` (restore time).\n  - Output variables: `QU` (raise output), `QD` (lower output), `STATUS` (state output), `PO` (position output), `AO` (angle output).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `ps` (saved position), `as` (saved angle), `last` (last operation time).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the current time `tx` is converted to the `TIME` type for subsequent use.\n  \n  -- REGION Manual Override Logic\n    If the enable signal `IN` is true, and either manual override `OVERRIDE_MANUAL` is enabled or both raise `UP` and lower `DN` signals are received simultaneously, the `STATUS` is set to `178`, indicating manual override mode.\n\n  -- REGION State Machine\n    The logic varies based on the current `STATUS`:\n    - State `0`: Initial state, where `STATUS` is set to the input state `S_IN`.\n    - State `178`: Manual override mode. The position output `PO` and angle output `AO` are set to override values `PX` and `AX`, while the raise output `QU` and lower output `QD` are set to true. If the enable signal `IN` is false, the system checks `RESTORE_POSITION` to decide whether to enter recovery state `179` and records the current time `last`.\n    - State `179`: Recovery mode. The position output `PO` and angle output `AO` are set to saved values `ps` and `as`. If the current position and angle match the input values or the `RESTORE_TIME` has elapsed, the `STATUS` is reset to the input state `S_IN`.\n    - Default state: The position output `PO` and angle output `AO` are set to input values `PI` and `AI`, and these values are saved to `ps` and `as`. The `STATUS` is also set to `S_IN`, while `QU` and `QD` are updated based on the `UP` and `DN` signals.\n\n  -- REGION Output Update\n    In each branch of the state machine, the output variables `QU`, `QD`, `STATUS`, `PO`, and `AO` are updated according to the current state and logic.", "name": "BLIND_SET"}

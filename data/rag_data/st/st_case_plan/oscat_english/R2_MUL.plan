{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function `R2_MUL` designed to multiply a two-dimensional real number structure `REAL2` by a scalar real number `Y`. The function returns a new `REAL2` structure where each component is the product of the original structure's corresponding component and the scalar.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `X`: A `REAL2` structure containing two real number components, `RX` and `R1`.\n    - `Y`: A scalar real number used to multiply each component of the `REAL2` structure.\n  - Output Variables:\n    - The function returns a `REAL2` structure with two components, `RX` and `R1`, which are the products of the corresponding components of the input structure `X` and the scalar `Y`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Multiplication Calculation:\n     - Multiply the component `RX` of the input structure `X` by the scalar `Y`, and assign the result to the `RX` component of the output structure.\n     - Multiply the component `R1` of the input structure `X` by the scalar `Y`, and assign the result to the `R1` component of the output structure.\n  -- REGION Return Result:\n     - The function returns the computed `REAL2` structure with the updated `RX` and `R1` components.\n\n- Example\n  If `X.RX = 2.0`, `X.R1 = 3.0`, and `Y = 4.0`, the function will return a `REAL2` structure with:\n  - `RX = 2.0 * 4.0 = 8.0`\n  - `R1 = 3.0 * 4.0 = 12.0`", "name": "R2_MUL"}

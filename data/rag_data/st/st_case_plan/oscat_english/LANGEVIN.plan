{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `LANGEVIN`, which calculates the value of the Langevin function. The Langevin function is commonly used in physics to describe the relationship between magnetization and magnetic fields. The function takes a real number input `X` and returns the corresponding result based on the value of `X`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input value for the Langevin function, of type `REAL` (real number).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n     1. If the input `X` equals `0.0`, it directly returns `0.0`. This is because the Langevin function evaluates to `0` when `X` is `0`.\n     2. If `X` is not equal to `0.0`, it calculates the Langevin function value using the formula `COTH(X) - 1.0 / X`, where `COTH` is the hyperbolic cotangent function.\n     The result is returned via the `LANGEVIN` variable.\n\n  The implementation of this function is concise and straightforward, performing conditional checks and calculations based on the input value `X` to ultimately return the Langevin function value.", "name": "LANGEVIN"}

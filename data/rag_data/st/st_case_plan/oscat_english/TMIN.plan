{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `TMIN`, which implements a timer function. It is based on a hypothetical timer type `TP` and controls the output signal `Q` using the input signal `IN` and the timer duration `PT`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (Boolean type, representing the timer's start signal), `PT` (time type, representing the timer's preset duration).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (Boolean type, representing the timer's output signal).\n  - Internal variables: `pm` (assumed to be an instance of type `TP`, used to implement the timer function).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Timer Logic\n     This region implements the core logic of the timer. First, it calls the internal timer instance `pm`, passing the input signal `IN` and the preset duration `PT` to `pm`. Then, it sets the output signal `Q` to the logical OR result of the input signal `IN` or `pm.Q`. This means that if `IN` is true, or if the timer `pm`'s output `Q` is true, then `Q` will be true.\n\n  The key aspect of this code lies in using the timer instance `pm` of type `TP` to implement the timing function. By passing `IN` and `PT` to `pm` and controlling the output `Q` based on the states of `pm.Q` and `IN`, it encapsulates the timer logic.", "name": "TMIN"}

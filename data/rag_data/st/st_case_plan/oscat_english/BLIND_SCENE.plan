{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'BLIND_SCENE', designed to control scenes for blinds. It adjusts the position and angle of the blinds based on input signals (such as up, down, scene selection, etc.) and outputs corresponding statuses and parameters.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: UP (raise signal), DN (lower signal), S_IN (status input), PI (position input), AI (angle input), ENABLE (enable signal), SWRITE (scene write signal), SCENE (scene selection).\n - Output variables: QU (raise output), QD (lower output), STATUS (status output), PO (position output), AO (angle output).\n - Retained variables: sx (a 16x3 array storing scene positions, angles, and enable statuses).\n - Temporary variables: x (stores the scene index).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Scene Selection and Output Control\n   First, the scene index `x` is calculated as the bitwise AND result of `SCENE` input and `16#0F`. Then, it checks if the enable signal `ENABLE` is true, the current scene's enable status `sx[x,2]` is greater than 0, and the raise signal `UP` and lower signal `DN` are true. If conditions are met, the position and angle are read from the scene array `sx` and assigned to outputs `PO` and `AO`, while the status output `STATUS` is set to `160 + x`, and `QU` and `QD` are set to true. If conditions are not met, the input signals `UP` and `DN` are directly assigned to outputs `QU` and `QD`, and the input status `S_IN`, position `PI`, and angle `AI` are assigned to outputs `STATUS`, `PO`, and `AO`.\n\n-- REGION Scene Writing\n   If the `SWRITE` signal is true, the scene writing logic is executed. First, the status output `STATUS` is set to `176`. Then, the input position `PI` and angle `AI` are written to the corresponding positions `sx[x,0]` and `sx[x,1]` in the scene array `sx`. If the enable signal `ENABLE` is true, the scene's enable status `sx[x,2]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block reads or writes the position and angle of the blinds based on the scene selection signal `SCENE` and controls the raising and lowering of the blinds using input signals `UP` and `DN`. The status output `STATUS` indicates the current operation status, such as successful scene selection or scene writing completion. The retained variable `sx` stores the positions, angles, and enable statuses of different scenes, ensuring data persistence after power loss.", "name": "BLIND_SCENE"}

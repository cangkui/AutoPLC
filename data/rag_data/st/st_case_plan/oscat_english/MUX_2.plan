{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple 2-way multiplexer (MUX) function named 'MUX_2'. Its purpose is to select one of two input signals (D0 and D1) as the output based on the value of the selection signal (A0).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - D0: Boolean-type input signal 1.\n    - D1: Boolean-type input signal 2.\n    - A0: Boolean-type selection signal, which determines whether the output is D0 or D1.\n  - Output variable:\n    - MUX_2: Boolean-type output signal, whose value is determined by the selection signal A0.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function is very simple, utilizing a built-in `SEL` function to implement the multiplexing functionality. The `SEL` function is defined as follows:\n    - If A0 is FALSE, the output is D0.\n    - If A0 is TRUE, the output is D1.\n    Thus, the value of `MUX_2` is selected from either D0 or D1 based on the value of A0.\n\n    For example:\n    - If A0 = FALSE, then MUX_2 = D0.\n    - If A0 = TRUE, then MUX_2 = D1.\n\n    This type of logic is very common in digital circuits, where it is used to select different input signals as outputs based on control signals.\n\n- Summary\n  This function implements a simple 2-way multiplexer that selects one of two input signals (D0 or D1) as the output based on the selection signal A0. This functionality is useful in scenarios such as signal selection and data routing.", "name": "MUX_2"}

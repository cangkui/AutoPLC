{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This simple function, named `CCON`, is used to compute the complex conjugate of a given complex number. The complex conjugate is obtained by negating the imaginary part of the number while keeping the real part unchanged.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Output variable: `CCON`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the computed complex conjugate.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Compute Complex Conjugate\n    The core logic in this region is straightforward:\n    1. Assign the real part of the input complex number `X` directly to the real part of the output complex number `CCON`.\n    2. Negate the imaginary part of the input complex number `X` and assign it to the imaginary part of the output complex number `CCON`.\n    Through these two steps, the function `CCON` returns the complex conjugate of the input number.\n\n  For example, if the input complex number `X` is `3 + 4i`, the output complex number `CCON` will be `3 - 4i`.", "name": "CCON"}

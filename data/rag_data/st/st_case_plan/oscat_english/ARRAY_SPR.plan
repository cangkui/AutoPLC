Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block, named `ARRAY_SPR`, is used to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values (i.e., the range) in a given array. The function block accepts a pointer to a real number array and the size of the array as inputs, and returns the computed range value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `pt` is a pointer to the real number array, and `size` is the size of the array (in bytes).\n - Internal variables: `i` is a loop counter, `stop` is the loop termination condition, `array_max` stores the maximum value in the array, and `array_min` stores the minimum value in the array.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the loop termination condition `stop` is calculated. Since `size` is the array size in bytes and `pt` points to a real number array, `size` needs to be converted to the number of array elements. The formula is `(size - SIZEOF(pt)) / SIZEOF(pt)`, where `SIZEOF(pt)` is the size of a single element in the array (4 bytes for a real number).\n    Next, `array_min` and `array_max` are initialized to the first element of the array, `pt^[0]`.\n\n -- REGION Loop Calculation\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each element of the array (starting from the second element). In each iteration:\n     - If the current element `pt^[i]` is greater than `array_max`, `array_max` is updated to the current element.\n     - If the current element `pt^[i]` is less than `array_min`, `array_min` is updated to the current element.\n    After the loop completes, the maximum and minimum values in the array are stored in `array_max` and `array_min`, respectively.\n\n -- REGION Compute and Return Result\n    The range value `array_spr` is calculated as `array_max - array_min` and returned as the output of the function block.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block traverses the elements of the array to find the maximum and minimum values and computes their difference. The returned range value can be used to analyze the distribution of elements in the array.", "name": "ARRAY_SPR"}

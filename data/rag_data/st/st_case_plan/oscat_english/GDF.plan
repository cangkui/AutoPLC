{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `GDF` that takes a real number `X` as input and calculates and returns a real number result based on different ranges of `X`. The main logic of the function involves conditional checks to handle various input scenarios and return the corresponding computation results.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value of the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Conditional Checks and Computations\n     This section handles different input cases through conditional checks:\n     1. If `X` equals `0.0`, the function returns `0.0`.\n     2. If `X` is greater than `15.0`, the function returns `math.PI05` (assuming `math.PI05` is a predefined constant representing π/2 or another value).\n     3. If `X` is less than `-15.0`, the function returns `-math.PI05`.\n     4. If `X` falls outside the above ranges, it computes `ATAN(EXP(X)) * 2.0 - math.PI05` and returns the result. Here:\n        - `ATAN` is the arctangent function, returning the arctangent of the input value.\n        - `EXP` is the exponential function, returning `e` raised to the power of `X`.\n        - `math.PI05` is a predefined constant, possibly representing π/2 or another value.\n\n  The final result of the function is determined by the above conditional checks and computational logic, returning the appropriate value.", "name": "GDF"}

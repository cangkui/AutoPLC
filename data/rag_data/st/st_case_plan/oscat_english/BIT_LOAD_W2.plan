  "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `BIT_LOAD_W2`, which performs bitwise operations on an input `WORD`-type variable `I` based on a Boolean input `D`. The function generates and returns a new `WORD` value through shifting and logical operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables:\n   - `I`: A `WORD`-type variable representing the original data to be bitwise manipulated.\n   - `D`: A `BOOL`-type variable controlling the mode of the bitwise operation.\n   - `P`: An `INT`-type variable indicating the number of rotation bits.\n   - `N`: An `INT`-type variable indicating the number of shift bits.\n - Output variable:\n   - `BIT_LOAD_W2`: A `WORD`-type variable representing the result returned by the function.\n\n- Core Logic\nThe function's main logic selects different bitwise operation methods based on the value of input variable `D`:\n 1. If `D` is `TRUE`, the following operations are performed:\n    - Use `SHR` to right-shift `WORD#65535` by `(16 - N)` bits, generating a mask.\n    - Use `ROR` to right-rotate the input variable `I` by `P` bits.\n    - Perform an `OR` operation on the two results above.\n    - Use `ROL` to left-rotate the result by `P` bits, ultimately yielding `BIT_LOAD_W2`.\n 2. If `D` is `FALSE`, the following operations are performed:\n    - Use `SHL` to left-shift `WORD#65535` by `N` bits, generating a mask.\n    - Use `ROR` to right-rotate the input variable `I` by `P` bits.\n    - Perform an `AND` operation on the two results above.\n    - Use `ROL` to left-rotate the result by `P` bits, ultimately yielding `BIT_LOAD_W2`.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function returns `BIT_LOAD_W2`, the generated `WORD` value based on the input parameters and logic.\n\n- Key Explanations\n - `ROL` and `ROR`: These are left-rotate and right-rotate operations, respectively, used to cyclically shift bits left or right.\n - `SHL` and `SHR`: These are left-shift and right-shift operations, respectively, used to shift bits left or right, filling empty bits with `0`.\n - `OR` and `AND`: These are logical OR and AND operations, respectively, used for bit-level logical operations on two data values.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple SCL function named `HYPOT`, designed to calculate the Euclidean norm (i.e., the hypotenuse length of a right-angled triangle) of two real numbers. It takes two input variables, `X` and `Y`, and returns the square root of the sum of their squares.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of real type, representing the two legs of a right-angled triangle.\n  - Output variable: `HYPOT`, of real type, representing the hypotenuse length of the triangle.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Hypotenuse Length\n    The core logic of the function uses the formula `HYPOT := SQRT(x*x + y*y)` to compute the hypotenuse length. The specific steps are:\n    1. Calculate the square of `X` (`x*x`).\n    2. Calculate the square of `Y` (`y*y`).\n    3. Sum the two squared values (`x*x + y*y`).\n    4. Take the square root of the summed result (`SQRT(x*x + y*y)`).\n    5. Assign the result to the output variable `HYPOT`.\n\n    This function implements basic mathematical operations and is suitable for scenarios requiring distance calculations between two points in 2D space or determining the hypotenuse length of a right-angled triangle.", "name": "HYPOT"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `ELEMENT_COUNT` that calculates the number of specific separators in a string. The function takes a separator as input and returns the count of that separator in the string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `SEP`, representing the separator, of type `BYTE`.\n  - Input/output variable: `ELEMENT`, representing the string to be processed, of type `STRING[ELEMENT_LENGTH]`.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pt`, a pointer to the string, of type `POINTER TO ARRAY[1..ELEMENT_LENGTH] OF BYTE`.\n    - `l`, representing the length of the string, of type `INT`.\n    - `pos`, representing the current character position being processed, of type `INT`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. **Empty String Check**:\n       - If the input string `ELEMENT` is empty, return `0` immediately, indicating no separators are present.\n    2. **Initialization**:\n       - If the string is not empty, first retrieve the address of the string and assign it to the pointer `pt`.\n       - Initialize `ELEMENT_COUNT` to `1`, indicating there is at least one element.\n       - Retrieve the length of the string and assign it to the variable `l`.\n    3. **String Traversal**:\n       - Use a `FOR` loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n       - If the current character matches the separator `SEP`, increment `ELEMENT_COUNT` by `1`, indicating a new separator has been found.\n    4. **Return Result**:\n       - After the loop completes, return the value of `ELEMENT_COUNT`, which is the count of separators in the string plus `1` (representing the total number of elements).", "name": "ELEMENT_COUNT"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a dual-threshold comparator function block with hysteresis, named 'HYST_3'. Based on the comparison between the input value (`in`) and two thresholds (`val1` and `val2`), it outputs two boolean values (`Q1` and `Q2`). The hysteresis feature is achieved via the `hyst` parameter, preventing frequent output toggling near the threshold values.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in` (input value), `hyst` (hysteresis range), `val1` (first threshold), `val2` (second threshold).\n - Output variables: `Q1` (first output), `Q2` (second output).\n - Internal variable: `X` (half of the hysteresis range).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Hysteresis Calculation:\n    First, half of the hysteresis range is calculated and stored in variable `X`. The formula is: `X := hyst * 0.5;`. This value introduces hysteresis around the thresholds to prevent frequent output switching near them.\n   \n-- REGION Threshold Comparison and Output Logic:\n    The outputs `Q1` and `Q2` are updated based on the comparison between the input value `in` and the thresholds `val1` and `val2`.\n   - For `Q1`:\n     - If `in` is less than `val1 - X`, `Q1` is set to `TRUE`.\n     - If `in` is greater than `val1 + X`, `Q1` is set to `FALSE`.\n   - For `Q2`:\n     - If `in` is less than `val2 - X`, `Q2` is set to `FALSE`.\n     - If `in` is greater than `val2 + X`, `Q2` is set to `TRUE`.\n\n- Output Result\nUltimately, the values of `Q1` and `Q2` are determined by the comparison between the input `in` and the thresholds `val1` and `val2`, incorporating hysteresis. This design effectively prevents frequent output switching caused by noise or minor fluctuations near the threshold values.", "name": "HYST_3"}

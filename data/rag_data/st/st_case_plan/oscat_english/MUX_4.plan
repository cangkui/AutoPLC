{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple 4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) function block named 'MUX_4'. It selects one output from four input signals (D0, D1, D2, D3) based on two selection signals (A0 and A1).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: Four data inputs (D0, D1, D2, D3) and two selection signals (A0, A1).\n - Output variable: A Boolean value (MUX_4), representing the selected input signal based on the selection signals.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   The logic of this function block is very straightforwardâ€”it selects one output from four input signals using the two selection signals (A0 and A1). The specific logic is as follows:\n   1. First, check the value of selection signal A1:\n      - If A1 is true, further check the value of selection signal A0:\n        - If A0 is true, output D3.\n        - If A0 is false, output D2.\n      - If A1 is false, further check the value of selection signal A0:\n        - If A0 is true, output D1.\n        - If A0 is false, output D0.\n   2. Finally, the selected input signal determined by the above logic is assigned to the output variable MUX_4.\n\nSummary: This function block implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer by using a two-level selection logic (A1 and A0) to choose one output from four input signals.", "name": "MUX_4"}

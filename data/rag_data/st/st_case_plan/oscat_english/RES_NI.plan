{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `RES_NI` to calculate the resistance value of a certain material. The resistance value is related to temperature `T` and the reference resistance `R0`, computed through a polynomial formula. The formula uses three constants `A`, `B`, and `C`, representing different degrees of temperature's influence on resistance.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `T` (temperature) and `R0` (reference resistance).\n  - Constants: `A`, `B`, and `C`, representing the coefficients of temperature's influence on resistance.\n  - Internal variable: `T2`, used to store the squared value of temperature.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculation Logic:\n     1. First, compute the squared value of temperature `T2`, i.e., `T2 := T * T`.\n     2. Then, calculate the resistance value `RES_NI` using the polynomial formula:\n        ```\n        RES_NI := R0 + A * T + B * T2 + C * T2 * T2\n        ```\n        Where:\n        - `R0` is the reference resistance.\n        - `A * T` represents the linear influence of temperature on resistance.\n        - `B * T2` represents the quadratic influence of temperature on resistance.\n        - `C * T2 * T2` represents the quartic influence of temperature on resistance.\n     3. Finally, the function returns the computed resistance value `RES_NI`.\n\n  The core logic of this function quantifies the temperature's influence on resistance through the polynomial formula and calculates the final resistance value based on the reference resistance `R0`. This calculation method is typically used to simulate how a material's resistance changes with temperature.", "name": "RES_NI"}

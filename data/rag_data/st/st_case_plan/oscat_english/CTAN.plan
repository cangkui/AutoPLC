{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CTAN`, which calculates the hyperbolic tangent (Complex Tangent) of a complex number. The hyperbolic tangent function is a crucial operation in complex arithmetic, widely used in signal processing, control systems, and mathematical modeling.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Internal variables: `temp`, `xi2`, `xr2`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n  - Output variable: `CTAN`, representing the computed complex hyperbolic tangent value, including the real part (`CTAN.re`) and the imaginary part (`CTAN.im`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Intermediate Variables\n     - First, compute twice the imaginary part of the complex number and store it in `xi2`: `xi2 := 2.0 * x.im`.\n     - Then, compute twice the real part of the complex number and store it in `xr2`: `xr2 := 2.0 * x.re`.\n  -- REGION Calculate Denominator\n     - Compute the denominator: `COS(xr2) + COSH(xi2)`, where `COS` is the cosine function and `COSH` is the hyperbolic cosine function.\n     - Store the reciprocal of the denominator in `temp`: `temp := 1.0 / (COS(xr2) + COSH(xi2))`.\n  -- REGION Calculate Real and Imaginary Parts\n     - Compute the real part: `CTAN.re := temp * SIN(xr2)`, where `SIN` is the sine function.\n     - Compute the imaginary part: `CTAN.im := temp * SINH(xi2)`, where `SINH` is the hyperbolic sine function.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     - Finally, assign the computed real and imaginary parts to the output variable `CTAN` and return the result.\n\n- Algorithm Flow\n  1. Input a complex number `X`.\n  2. Calculate twice the imaginary and real parts, storing them in `xi2` and `xr2`, respectively.\n  3. Compute the denominator, `COS(xr2) + COSH(xi2)`, and store its reciprocal in `temp`.\n  4. Multiply `temp` by `SIN(xr2)` and `SINH(xi2)` to obtain the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.\n  5. Assign the results to the output variable `CTAN` and return it.\n\n- Output\n  The function outputs a complex number with a real part `CTAN.re` and an imaginary part `CTAN.im`, representing the hyperbolic tangent of the input complex number.", "name": "CTAN"}

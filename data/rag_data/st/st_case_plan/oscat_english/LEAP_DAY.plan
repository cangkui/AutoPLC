Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block is named 'LEAP_DAY' and is used to determine whether a given date is a leap day. It converts the date into an unsigned double-word integer and uses modulo operations to check if the date meets specific conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: IDATE, representing the input date.\n - Output variable: LEAP_DAY, indicating the result of the check. If the input date is a leap day, it returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   This region contains the core logic of the function block. First, the input date (IDATE) is converted into an unsigned double-word integer (UDINT). Then, a modulo operation (MOD) is performed on this integer with the constant 126230400. If the result is 68169600, LEAP_DAY is set to TRUE, indicating the input date is a leap day; otherwise, LEAP_DAY is set to FALSE, indicating it is not a leap day.\n\n   Specifically, the logic of this code is based on calculations within a specific time range. The constants 126230400 and 68169600 likely represent certain time intervals or specific date offsets used to determine leap days. This calculation method may be based on a particular calendar system or time representation.", "name": "LEAP_DAY"}

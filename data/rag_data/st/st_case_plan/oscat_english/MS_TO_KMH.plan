{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block used to convert speed from meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/h). It takes an input value (in m/s) and returns the converted value (in km/h).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `ms`, representing speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Conversion Logic\n     The core logic of this function block is to convert the input speed value from m/s to km/h. The conversion formula is:\n     ```\n     MS_TO_KMH := ms * 3.6\n     ```\n     Here, `3.6` is the conversion factor since 1 m/s equals 3.6 km/h. The function block directly returns the calculated value.\n\n- Output Result\n  The output of the function block is the converted speed value in kilometers per hour (km/h).", "name": "MS_TO_KMH"}

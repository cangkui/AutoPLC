{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function block `SH_T`, designed to pass an input value to the output when a condition is met. The block includes an input variable `IN` (real type) and an enable signal `E` (Boolean type). When the enable signal `E` is true, the input value `IN` is assigned to the output `OUT`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` is a real-type variable representing the input value; `E` is a Boolean-type variable representing the enable signal.\n  - Output variable: `OUT` is a real-type variable representing the output value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The logic of the function block is very straightforward:\n    - If the enable signal `E` is true, the input value `IN` is assigned to the output `OUT`.\n    - If the enable signal `E` is false, no action is taken, and the output `OUT` retains its current value.\n\n    The logic is implemented with the following code:\n    ```plaintext\n    IF E THEN\n        OUT := IN;\n    END_IF;\n    ```\n\n    This code works as follows: When `E` is true, the value of `IN` is passed to `OUT`; otherwise, the value of `OUT` remains unchanged.", "name": "SH_T"}

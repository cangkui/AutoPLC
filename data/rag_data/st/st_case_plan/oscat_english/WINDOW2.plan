{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `WINDOW2` to determine whether an input value falls within a specified range. The function takes three input parameters: `LOW` (the lower bound of the range), `IN` (the input value to check), and `HIGH` (the upper bound of the range). It returns a boolean value indicating whether the input value lies within the `[LOW, HIGH]` range.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input Variables:\n   - `LOW`: The lower bound of the range, of type `REAL`.\n   - `IN`: The input value to be checked, of type `REAL`.\n   - `HIGH`: The upper bound of the range, of type `REAL`.\n - Output Variable:\n   - `WINDOW2`: A boolean value indicating whether the input value is within the specified range.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   The core logic of the function is straightforward, using a boolean expression to check if the input value `IN` lies within the `[LOW, HIGH]` range. The specific logic is as follows:\n   - Use `IN >= LOW` to check if the input value is greater than or equal to the lower bound.\n   - Use `IN <= HIGH` to check if the input value is less than or equal to the upper bound.\n   - Combine the two conditions with `AND`, meaning the input value must satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n   - Assign the result to `WINDOW2`. If the input value is within the range, `WINDOW2` is `TRUE`; otherwise, it is `FALSE`.\n\n   Examples:\n   - If `LOW = 10.0`, `IN = 15.0`, and `HIGH = 20.0`, then `WINDOW2` is `TRUE` because `15.0` falls within the `[10.0, 20.0]` range.\n   - If `LOW = 10.0`, `IN = 25.0`, and `HIGH = 20.0`, then `WINDOW2` is `FALSE` because `25.0` is outside the `[10.0, 20.0]` range.", "name": "WINDOW2"}

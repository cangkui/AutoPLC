{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `WATER_DENSITY`, is used to calculate the density of water. Based on the input temperature `T` and saturation state `Sat`, it computes the water density using a polynomial formula and applies a saturation correction if needed.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `T`: Temperature, type `REAL`.\n    - `Sat`: Saturation state, type `BOOL`, indicating whether to apply saturation correction to the density.\n  - Constants:\n    - `a0` to `a5`: Polynomial coefficients, type `REAL`, used for calculating water density.\n    - `b`: Correction coefficient, type `REAL`, for adjusting the density calculation.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `T2`: Square of temperature, type `REAL`.\n    - `T4`: Fourth power of temperature, type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Water Density\n    First, compute the square `T2` and fourth power `T4` of the temperature. Then, calculate the water density using the polynomial formula:\n    ```\n    WATER_DENSITY = (a0 + a1*T + a2*T2 + a3*T2*T + a4*T4 + a5*T4*T) / (1.0 + b*T)\n    ```\n    This formula estimates water density through polynomial fitting, accounting for temperature effects.\n  -- REGION Saturation Correction\n    If the input parameter `Sat` is `TRUE`, apply the following saturation correction to the calculated density:\n    ```\n    WATER_DENSITY := WATER_DENSITY - 0.004612 + 0.000106 * T\n    ```\n    This correction term adjusts the density value under saturation conditions.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    Finally, the function returns the computed or corrected `WATER_DENSITY` value.", "name": "WATER_DENSITY"}

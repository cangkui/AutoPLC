{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `SINC` to compute the value of the Sinc function in mathematics. The Sinc function is widely used in signal processing, mathematical analysis, and other fields. Its definition is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{sinc}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, representing the input value for the Sinc function, of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n - Return value: `SINC`, representing the computed result of the Sinc function, of type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   - First, check if the input value `X` equals `0.0`. If `X` is `0.0`, directly set the return value `SINC` to `1.0`, as the Sinc function equals `1` when `x = 0`.\n   - If `X` is not `0.0`, compute \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) and assign the result to `SINC`. Here, the `SIN` function is used to calculate the sine of the input value `X`, which is then divided by `X` itself.\n   - Finally, the function returns the computed `SINC` value.\n\n- Notes\n - Since the Sinc function is undefined at `x = 0` (division by zero), this case must be handled explicitly in the implementation. This code addresses it by returning `1.0` via a conditional check, which is the limit value of the Sinc function at `x = 0`.\n - For non-zero input values, precision issues with floating-point numbers should be considered when computing \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\), especially when `x` is close to zero.", "name": "SINC"}

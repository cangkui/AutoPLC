{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `IS_LOWER`, is used to determine whether all characters in a string are lowercase letters. If every character in the string is a lowercase letter, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the input string.\n  - Local variables:\n    - `l`, used to store the length of the string.\n    - `pt`, a pointer to the string, used to access each character sequentially.\n    - `pos`, used in loops to indicate the current character position.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - First, the address of the string `str` is obtained using `ADR(str)` and assigned to the pointer `pt`.\n     - The length of the string is obtained using `LEN(str)` and assigned to the variable `l`.\n\n  -- REGION Character Check\n     - A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string, from position 1 to the string length `l`.\n     - Within the loop, `ISC_LOWER(pt^)` checks whether the current character is a lowercase letter. `pt^` represents the character currently pointed to by `pt`.\n     - If the current character is not a lowercase letter, `IS_LOWER` is set to `FALSE`, and the function immediately returns, terminating execution.\n     - If the current character is a lowercase letter, the pointer `pt` is incremented by one byte to point to the next character.\n\n  -- REGION Final Judgment\n     - If the loop completes and all characters are lowercase letters, the string length `l` is checked to see if it is greater than 0.\n     - If the string length is greater than 0, `IS_LOWER` is set to `TRUE`, indicating that all characters in the string are lowercase letters.\n     - If the string length is 0, `IS_LOWER` retains its default value of `FALSE`.\n\n- Output Result\n  - The function returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`, indicating whether all characters in the string are lowercase letters.", "name": "IS_LOWER"}

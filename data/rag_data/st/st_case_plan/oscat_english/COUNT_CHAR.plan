{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `COUNT_CHAR` that counts the occurrences of a specific character in a string. It takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code uses the following variables:\n - Input variables: `str` is a string-type input, and `chr` is a byte-type input representing the character to be counted.\n - Local variables: `l` is an integer storing the string length; `pt` is a byte pointer for traversing the string; `pos` is an integer used for loop counting.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   The function first initializes local variables. `pt` is set to the starting address of `str`, `l` is assigned the string length, and `COUNT_CHAR` is initialized to 0, indicating the count starts from zero.\n\n-- REGION Character Counting\n   The function uses a `FOR` loop to iterate through each character in the string. The loop runs from 1 to the string length `l`. In each iteration, the function checks if the current character (pointed to by `pt`) matches the input character `chr`. If they match, `COUNT_CHAR` is incremented by 1. The pointer `pt` then moves forward by one byte to point to the next character.\n\n-- REGION Conclusion\n   After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `COUNT_CHAR`, which represents the number of times `chr` appears in `str`.\n\nSummary: The function traverses the string using a pointer, compares each character, counts the occurrences of the specified character, and finally returns the result.", "name": "COUNT_CHAR"}

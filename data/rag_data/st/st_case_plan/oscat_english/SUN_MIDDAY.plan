{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `SUN_MIDDAY` is used to calculate the solar noon time for a given longitude and UTC date. Solar noon refers to the time when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, typically around 12:00 local time. By accounting for Earth's rotation and revolution, the function accurately computes the precise solar noon time.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `LON`: Longitude (in degrees), representing the geographical location of the observation point.\n    - `UTC`: UTC date, representing the current date.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `T`: Represents the day of the year, converted from the UTC date using the `DAY_OF_YEAR` function.\n    - `OFFSET`: An adjustment value for the solar noon time, based on the periodic variations of Earth's revolution.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate the day of the year:\n     First, the `DAY_OF_YEAR` function converts the input UTC date into the day of the year, which is then stored as a real number in variable `T`.\n\n  -- REGION Calculate the solar noon time offset:\n     The offset is computed using the following formula:\n    ```plaintext\n    OFFSET := -0.1752 * SIN(0.033430 * T + 0.5474) - 0.1340 * SIN(0.018234 * T - 0.1939)\n    ```\n     This formula accounts for the periodic changes in Earth's revolution, reflecting the sun's positional variations throughout the year. The `SIN` function models the cyclical impact of Earth's orbit.\n\n  -- REGION Calculate the solar noon time:\n     Finally, the solar noon time is calculated using the formula:\n    ```plaintext\n    SUN_MIDDAY := HOUR_TO_TOD(12.0 - OFFSET - lon * 0.0666666666666)\n    ```\n     Where:\n    - `12.0` represents the standard noon time (12:00).\n    - `OFFSET` is the adjustment value derived from Earth's revolution.\n    - `lon * 0.0666666666666` adjusts the time based on longitude, as each 15 degrees of longitude corresponds to a 1-hour time difference (360 degrees / 24 hours = 15 degrees/hour).\n    - `HOUR_TO_TOD` converts the computed hour value into a time-of-day (TOD) type.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns `SUN_MIDDAY`, the calculated solar noon time, represented as a `TOD` type.", "name": "SUN_MIDDAY"}

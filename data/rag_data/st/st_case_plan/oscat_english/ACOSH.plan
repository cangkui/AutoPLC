{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function block for calculating the inverse hyperbolic cosine function (`ACOSH`). The inverse hyperbolic cosine function is the inverse of the hyperbolic cosine function and is typically used to compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine value of a given input. The function block accepts a real number input `X` and returns its inverse hyperbolic cosine value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, representing the value for which the inverse hyperbolic cosine is to be calculated.\n - Output variable: `ACOSH`, representing the computed inverse hyperbolic cosine value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Compute Inverse Hyperbolic Cosine\n   The logic of the function block is very straightforward, directly using the mathematical formula to compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine value. The formula is as follows:\n   ```\n   ACOSH := LN(SQRT(X * X - 1.0) + X)\n   ```\n   The following mathematical functions are used here:\n   - `SQRT`: Computes the square root.\n   - `LN`: Computes the natural logarithm.\n   The implementation steps of the formula are:\n   1. Compute `X * X - 1.0`, resulting in the value of `X` squared minus 1.\n   2. Take the square root of the above result to get `SQRT(X * X - 1.0)`.\n   3. Add the square root result to `X`, yielding `SQRT(X * X - 1.0) + X`.\n   4. Take the natural logarithm of the above result to obtain `LN(SQRT(X * X - 1.0) + X)`, which is the inverse hyperbolic cosine value.\n   Finally, assign the computed result to the output variable `ACOSH`.", "name": "ACOSH"}

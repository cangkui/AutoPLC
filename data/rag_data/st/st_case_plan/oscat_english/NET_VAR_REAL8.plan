{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block is named `NET_VAR_REAL8` and is used to transmit and process 8 real-number (REAL) data types in network communication. It utilizes input and output buffers (`X.S_BUF` and `X.R_BUF`) to send and receive data, and the state (`X.STATE`) determines whether to send or receive data. The function block also includes error-handling mechanisms to ensure data transmission integrity.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: `X`, which stores buffer and state information for network communication.\n  - Input Variables: `IN1` to `IN8`, representing 8 real-number inputs.\n  - Output Variables: `OUT1` to `OUT8`, representing 8 real-number outputs; `ID`, a unique identifier for the current function block.\n  - Internal Variables: `init` (initialization flag), `i` and `i2` (loop counters), `index` and `index2` (buffer indices), `r_dw` (used to store DWORD-type data), `ra` (an array for storing 8 real numbers).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     When the function block runs for the first time, the `init` flag is false, triggering the initialization logic. First, `init` is set to true, then `X.ID_MAX` is incremented, and the current function block's `ID` is set to the value of `X.ID_MAX`. This ensures each function block has a unique ID.\n\n  -- REGION Data Transmission and Processing\n     If `X.STATE` is greater than 0 and `X.ERROR_ID` is 0, data transmission processing begins.\n     - **Sending Data (`X.STATE = BYTE#1`)**:\n       First, check if the buffer index is out of bounds. If so, set the error ID to the current function block's ID. Otherwise, store the 8 input real numbers into the `ra` array and write the function block's ID and flag (`BYTE#15`) into the send buffer (`X.S_BUF.BUFFER`). Then, convert each real number to DWORD type and write its bytes into the buffer one by one.\n     - **Receiving Data (`X.STATE = BYTE#2`)**:\n       First, check if the data in the receive buffer matches the current function block's ID and flag. If not, set the error ID to the current function block's ID. Otherwise, read the DWORD-type data from the receive buffer, convert it back to real numbers, and store it in the `ra` array. Finally, assign the values in the `ra` array to the output variables `OUT1` to `OUT8`.\n     After processing the data, update the buffer index `X.index`.\n\n  -- REGION Error Handling\n     If an error is detected during data transmission (e.g., buffer overflow or data mismatch), set `X.ERROR_ID` to the current function block's ID for subsequent handling.", "name": "NET_VAR_REAL8"}

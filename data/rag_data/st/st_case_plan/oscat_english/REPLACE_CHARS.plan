{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block is named `REPLACE_CHARS` and is used to replace certain characters in the input string `STR`. It takes three input parameters: `STR` (the original string), `SRC` (the set of characters to be replaced), and `REP` (the set of replacement characters). The logic of the block is to replace all characters in `STR` that appear in `SRC` with the corresponding characters in `REP`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `STR` (original string), `SRC` (characters to be replaced), `REP` (replacement characters).\n  - Internal variables: `a` and `b` (used to store string lengths and indices), `c` (used to store a single character), `stp` (used to store string length).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, assign the input string `STR` to the output variable `REPLACE_CHARS`. Then, calculate the lengths of `SRC` and `REP`, storing them in variables `a` and `b` respectively. If the length of `SRC` is less than that of `REP`, truncate `REP` to the first `a` characters; if the length of `REP` is less than that of `SRC`, truncate `SRC` to the first `b` characters. This step ensures that `SRC` and `REP` have the same length, allowing subsequent character replacement operations to proceed correctly.\n  \n  -- REGION Character Replacement\n     Next, calculate the length of `STR` and store it in variable `stp`. Use a `FOR` loop to iterate through each character in `STR`. Within the loop, use the `MID` function to retrieve the current character and store it in variable `c`. Then, use the `FIND` function to check if `c` appears in `SRC`. If a matching character is found (i.e., the `FIND` return value is greater than 0), use the `REPLACE` function to replace the corresponding character in `REPLACE_CHARS` with the character at the corresponding position in `REP`.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n     After the loop completes, all characters in `REPLACE_CHARS` that appear in `SRC` will have been replaced with the corresponding characters in `REP`. Finally, `REPLACE_CHARS` is returned as the output.", "name": "REPLACE_CHARS"}

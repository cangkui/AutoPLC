{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SWAP_BYTE2`, which swaps the byte order of a 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD). Specifically, it exchanges the bytes within the high 16 bits and low 16 bits of the input DWORD.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one input variable:\n  - `IN`: A 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD) serving as the function's input.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The function's logic performs byte swapping through bitwise operations. The steps are as follows:\n     1. Use `ROR(in, 8)` to rotate the input DWORD right by 8 bits, then perform a bitwise AND with the mask `16#FF00FF00` to extract the high bytes from the high and low 16 bits.\n     2. Use `ROL(in, 8)` to rotate the input DWORD left by 8 bits, then perform a bitwise AND with the mask `16#00FF00FF` to extract the low bytes from the high and low 16 bits.\n     3. Combine the two results via a bitwise OR operation to obtain the final DWORD value with swapped bytes.\n     4. Assign the result to the function output `Swap_Byte2`.\n\n   For example, if the input `IN` is `16#AABBCCDD`, after swapping, the output will be `16#BBAADDCC`.", "name": "SWAP_BYTE2"}

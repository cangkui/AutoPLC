{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `MIRROR`, which reverses an input string and returns the reversed string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the string to be reversed.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `pi`: A pointer to the input string, of type pointer to a byte array.\n    - `po`: A pointer to the output string, of type pointer to a byte.\n    - `lx`: Represents the length of the input string, of type integer.\n    - `i`: Loop counter, of type integer.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the pointer `pi` is set to the address of the input string `str`, and the pointer `po` is set to the address of the output string `mirror`. Then, the length of the input string `str` is obtained using the `LEN` function and assigned to `lx`.\n  -- REGION String Reversal\n    A `FOR` loop is used to iterate from the last character of the string, copying each character to the output string one by one. The specific steps are:\n    1. `FOR i := lx TO 1 BY -1 DO`: Traverse the string from the last character backward.\n    2. `po^ := pi^[i]`: Copy the current character to the current position in the output string.\n    3. `po := po + 1`: Move the output string pointer forward by one position to write the next character.\n  -- REGION String Terminator\n    After the loop ends, the last position of the output string is set to `0`, indicating the string terminator.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function returns the reversed string `mirror`.", "name": "MIRROR"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function called `CEXP` to compute the exponential function of a complex number. The exponential function of a complex number is a common mathematical operation that maps one complex number to another. The input of the function is a complex number, and the output is also a complex number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Internal variable: `Temp`, of type `REAL`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute the Exponential Function of a Complex Number\n      First, the exponential value of the real part `X.re` of the input complex number `X` is calculated, and the result is stored in the temporary variable `Temp`. Then, Euler's formula is used to compute the exponential function of the complex number. The form of Euler's formula is:\n      \\[\n      e^{a + bi} = e^a \\cdot (\\cos(b) + i \\cdot \\sin(b))\n      \\]\n      Therefore, the real part of the output complex number `CEXP` is `Temp * COS(X.im)`, and the imaginary part is `Temp * SIN(X.im)`. Finally, the function returns the computed complex number `CEXP`.", "name": "CEXP"}

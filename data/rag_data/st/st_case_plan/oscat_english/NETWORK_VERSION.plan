Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `NETWORK_VERSION` that returns a version number based on an input signal. The function determines whether to return a DWORD value converted from a fixed date or a fixed numerical value, depending on the input boolean.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input variable: `IN`, a boolean type used to control the version number returned by the function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   This section contains the core logic of the function. First, it checks the value of the input variable `IN`. If `IN` is `TRUE`, the function returns a DWORD value converted from the date `D#2016-07-01`. If `IN` is `FALSE`, the function returns the fixed value `135`.\n\n   The specific logic is as follows:\n   - If `IN` is `TRUE`, the `DATE_TO_DWORD` function is called to convert the date `D#2016-07-01` into a DWORD type, and the result is assigned to `NETWORK_VERSION`.\n   - If `IN` is `FALSE`, the value `135` is directly assigned to `NETWORK_VERSION`.\n\n   The core logic of this function is very simple, using a boolean input variable to decide the returned version number. It is suitable for scenarios where different version numbers need to be returned based on conditions.", "name": "NETWORK_VERSION"}

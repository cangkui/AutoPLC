{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function named `CEIL`, used to calculate the ceiling value of a real number. The function takes a real number as input and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the real number to be rounded up.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function consists of two steps:\n     1. First, convert the input real number `X` into an integer `CEIL`. This uses the `REAL_TO_INT` function, which truncates the decimal part of the real number.\n     2. Then, check if the converted integer `CEIL` is less than the original real number `X`. If `CEIL < X`, it means the converted integer is the result of rounding down, so `CEIL` needs to be incremented by 1 to achieve rounding up.\n\n     Finally, the function returns the ceiling value as an integer.\n\n- Output\n   The function outputs the ceiling value as an integer. For example:\n   - If the input is `X = 3.2`, then `CEIL = 4`.\n   - If the input is `X = 5.0`, then `CEIL = 5`.\n   - If the input is `X = -2.7`, then `CEIL = -2`.", "name": "CEIL"}

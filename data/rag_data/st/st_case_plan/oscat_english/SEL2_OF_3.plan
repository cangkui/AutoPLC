{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function block named 'SEL2_OF_3', designed to select a valid value or compute an average from three input values. Its core logic involves comparing the differences between the three inputs to determine if they fall within an allowed deviation range, then outputting the corresponding value or an error flag based on the comparison results.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN1`, `IN2`, `IN3` (three input values of type `REAL`), `D` (allowed deviation range of type `REAL`).\n  - Output variables: `Y` (selected output value of type `REAL`), `W` (selected input identifier of type `INT`), `E` (error flag of type `BOOL`).\n  - Internal variables: `D12`, `D23`, `D31` (used to store comparison results between input values, of type `BOOL`).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Input Value Comparison\n     First, the absolute differences between the three input values are calculated and compared against the allowed deviation range `D`, with results stored in `D12`, `D23`, and `D31`:\n    - `D12`: Whether the difference between `IN1` and `IN2` is less than or equal to `D`.\n    - `D23`: Whether the difference between `IN2` and `IN3` is less than or equal to `D`.\n    - `D31`: Whether the difference between `IN3` and `IN1` is less than or equal to `D`.\n\n  -- REGION Selection Logic\n     Based on the comparison results, the following logic is executed:\n    - If any two comparison results are true (i.e., at least two input values are within the allowed deviation range), the average of the three input values is computed and output to `Y`, with the error flag `E` set to `FALSE` and the selection identifier `W` set to `0`.\n    - If only `D12` is true (i.e., `IN1` and `IN2` are within the allowed deviation range), the average of `IN1` and `IN2` is computed and output to `Y`, with the error flag `E` set to `FALSE` and the selection identifier `W` set to `3`.\n    - If only `D23` is true (i.e., `IN2` and `IN3` are within the allowed deviation range), the average of `IN2` and `IN3` is computed and output to `Y`, with the error flag `E` set to `FALSE` and the selection identifier `W` set to `1`.\n    - If only `D31` is true (i.e., `IN3` and `IN1` are within the allowed deviation range), the average of `IN3` and `IN1` is computed and output to `Y`, with the error flag `E` set to `FALSE` and the selection identifier `W` set to `2`.\n    - If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., the differences between all three input values exceed the allowed deviation range), the error flag `E` is set to `TRUE`, and the selection identifier `W` is set to `4`.\n\n  -- REGION Output Results\n     Finally, the function block outputs the values of `Y`, `W`, and `E` based on the above logic. `Y` represents the selected output value, `W` indicates the selected input identifier, and `E` signals whether an error has occurred.", "name": "SEL2_OF_3"}

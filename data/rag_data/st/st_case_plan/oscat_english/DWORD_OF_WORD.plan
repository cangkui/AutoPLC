{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `DWORD_OF_WORD`, which combines two input variables `W1` and `W0` of type `WORD` into a single output variable of type `DWORD`. The function achieves this by left-shifting `W1` by 16 bits and then performing a bitwise OR operation with `W0`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `W1` and `W0`, both of type `WORD`, representing the high 16 bits and low 16 bits of data, respectively.\n  - Output variable: `DWORD_OF_WORD`, of type `DWORD`, representing the combined 32-bit data.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Logic Implementation\n    The function's logic is very simple, consisting of just one line of code to combine two `WORD`-type data into a single `DWORD`-type data. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. First, convert `W1` to `DWORD` type and left-shift it by 16 bits, so that `W1` occupies the high 16 bits.\n    2. Then, convert `W0` to `DWORD` type and perform a bitwise OR operation with the left-shifted `W1`, placing `W0`'s data into the low 16 bits.\n    3. Finally, assign the combined result to the output variable `DWORD_OF_WORD`.\n\n  This operation is particularly useful in scenarios where two 16-bit data segments need to be merged into a single 32-bit data segment, such as when handling certain hardware registers or communication protocols.", "name": "DWORD_OF_WORD"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `CSINH` for calculating the hyperbolic sine of a complex number. The computation of the hyperbolic sine for a complex number is based on separate mathematical operations for its real and imaginary parts.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number, which includes a real part `X.re` and an imaginary part `X.im`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating the Hyperbolic Sine of a Complex Number\n    The formula for the hyperbolic sine of a complex number is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{CSINH}(X) = \\sinh(X.re) \\cdot \\cos(X.im) + j \\cdot \\cosh(X.re) \\cdot \\sin(X.im)\n    \\]\n    Where:\n    - `sinH(X.re)` calculates the hyperbolic sine of the real part.\n    - `COS(X.im)` calculates the cosine of the imaginary part.\n    - `cosH(X.re)` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the real part.\n    - `SIN(X.im)` calculates the sine of the imaginary part.\n    The results are assigned to `CSINH.re` (real part) and `CSINH.im` (imaginary part).\n\n    - Real Part Calculation: `CSINH.re := sinH(X.re) * COS(X.im)`\n      The hyperbolic sine of the real part is multiplied by the cosine of the imaginary part to obtain the real part of the complex hyperbolic sine.\n    - Imaginary Part Calculation: `CSINH.im := cosH(X.re) * SIN(X.im)`\n      The hyperbolic cosine of the real part is multiplied by the sine of the imaginary part to obtain the imaginary part of the complex hyperbolic sine.", "name": "CSINH"}

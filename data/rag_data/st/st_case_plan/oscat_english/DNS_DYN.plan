{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `DNS_DYN` is used for dynamically updating DNS records. It communicates with the DNS server via HTTP requests and supports two modes (`MODE = 0` and `MODE = 1`), allowing periodic DNS record updates. The function block employs a state machine to manage the update process and utilizes several sub-function blocks (such as `DNS_CLIENT`, `HTTP_GET`, and `BASE64_ENCODE_STR`) to perform specific network operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input/Output Variables**: Includes IP control structure (`IP_C`), send and receive buffers (`S_BUF`, `R_BUF`).\n  - **Input Variables**: Enable signal (`ENABLE`), update signal (`UPDATE`), update period (`T_UPDATE`), mode (`MODE`), hostname (`HOSTNAME`), username (`USERNAME`), password (`PASSWORD`), IP address (`IP4`).\n  - **Output Variables**: Busy signal (`BUSY`), completion signal (`DONE`), error code (`ERROR_C`), error type (`ERROR_T`).\n  - **Internal Variables**: Includes DNS client instance (`DNS_CLIENT`), HTTP GET instance (`HTTP_GET`), Base64 encoding instance (`BASE64_ENCODE_STR`), URL data structure (`URL_DATA`), update signal cache (`update_last`), state machine state (`state`), Base64 encoding completion flag (`base64_done`), temporary strings (`s1`, `s2`), timer (`w`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- **State Machine Logic**\n    The core logic of the function block is implemented via a state machine with the following states:\n    - **State 00**: Initialization state. If the enable signal is true and (the update signal is true or the timer expires), it transitions to state 20. In this state, the URL is constructed based on the mode (`MODE`), and the username and password are concatenated into string `s1`. If an IP address (`IP4`) is provided, it is appended to the URL.\n    - **State 20**: DNS resolution state. If DNS resolution is complete (`DNS_CLIENT.DONE`), it transitions to state 40. If DNS resolution fails, the error code and type are set, and it returns to state 00.\n    - **State 40**: Base64 encoding state. If Base64 encoding is complete (`base64_done`), the HTTP request header is constructed, and it transitions to state 60.\n    - **State 60**: HTTP request state. If the HTTP request is complete (`HTTP_GET.DONE`), the response content is parsed. If the response contains `good` or `nochg`, the update is successful; otherwise, the error code and type are set. If the HTTP request fails, the error code and type are set, and it returns to state 00.\n\n  -- **Sub-Function Block Calls**\n    - `DNS_CLIENT`: Used for DNS resolution, activated in state 20.\n    - `HTTP_GET`: Used for sending HTTP requests, activated in state 60.\n    - `BASE64_ENCODE_STR`: Used for Base64 encoding of the username and password, activated in state 40.\n\n  -- **Timer Logic**\n    If the update period (`T_UPDATE`) is greater than 0, the timer is started in state 00. When the timer expires, it triggers the state machine to transition to state 20, enabling periodic updates.\n\n  -- **Update Signal Cache**\n    The `update_last` variable caches the update signal to detect the rising edge of the update signal.\n\n- Output Results\n  - **BUSY**: Indicates whether the function block is processing a request.\n  - **DONE**: Indicates whether the DNS update was successfully completed.\n  - **ERROR_C**: Error code, used to specify the exact error.\n  - **ERROR_T**: Error type, used to identify the source of the error (DNS resolution, HTTP request, etc.).", "name": "DNS_DYN"}

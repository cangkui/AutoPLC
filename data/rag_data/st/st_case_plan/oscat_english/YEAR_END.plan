{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `YEAR_END`, which calculates the year-end date for a given year. It achieves this by converting the year into a specific date value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `y`, representing the year, of type `INT`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of the function involves a series of mathematical operations to convert the input year into a date value. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Convert the input year `y` to `DWORD` type.\n     2. Multiply the year by 1461 and then subtract 2876712. This operation converts the year into a specific base value.\n     3. Use the `SHR` (right shift) operation to shift the result right by 2 bits, equivalent to dividing by 4. This step converts the base value into days.\n     4. Multiply the days by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day) to convert it into seconds.\n     5. Finally, use the `DWORD_TO_DATE` function to convert the seconds into a date type and assign it to `YEAR_END`.\n\n  This calculation method is based on a specific date computation rule, likely used to map the year to a fixed year-end date (e.g., December 31).\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns a value of `DATE` type, representing the year-end date for the given year.", "name": "YEAR_END"}

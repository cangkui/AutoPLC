Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CATAN` to compute the arctangent (`arctan`) of a complex number. The arctangent of a complex number is itself a complex number, representing the angle and magnitude of a point on the complex plane. The function uses mathematical formulas to separately compute the real and imaginary parts, ultimately returning a complex result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number, with real part `X.re` and imaginary part `X.im`.\n  - Internal variables: `r2`, used to store the square of the real part of the input complex number; `num` and `den`, used as temporary storage for intermediate results during computation.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute Real Part:\n     First, the square of the real part of the input complex number is calculated and stored in `r2`. Then, the denominator `den` is computed using the formula `1.0 - r2 - X.im * X.im`. Next, the arctangent of the real part is calculated using the `ATAN` function with the formula `0.5 * ATAN(2.0 * X.re / den)`, and the result is assigned to the real part of the output complex number, `CATAN.re`.\n\n  -- REGION Compute Imaginary Part:\n     First, an intermediate value `num` is calculated using the formula `X.im + 1.0`, then `num` is updated to `r2 + num * num`. Next, an intermediate value `den` is calculated using the formula `X.im - 1.0`, then `den` is updated to `r2 + den * den`. Finally, the natural logarithmic difference for the imaginary part is computed using the `LN` function with the formula `0.25 * (LN(num) - LN(den))`, and the result is assigned to the imaginary part of the output complex number, `CATAN.im`.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result:\n     The function ultimately returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts `CATAN.re` and `CATAN.im`, respectively, representing the arctangent of the input complex number.\n\n- Summary\n  This function uses mathematical formulas to separately compute the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, ultimately returning its arctangent. The core logic involves the `ATAN` calculation for the real part and the natural logarithmic difference for the imaginary part. This implementation is suitable for mathematical operations on complex numbers and can accurately represent the angle and magnitude of a point on the complex plane.", "name": "CATAN"}

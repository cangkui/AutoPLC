{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function is named `OM_TO_F` and is used to convert angular velocity (in radians per second) to frequency (in Hertz). The input is the angular velocity `OM`, and the output is the frequency `OM_TO_F`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input variable: `OM`, representing angular velocity, of type `REAL`.\n  - Output variable: `OM_TO_F`, representing the converted frequency, of type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Frequency\n    The core logic of this function is to divide the input angular velocity `OM` by `2Ï€` (i.e., `math.PI2`) to convert it to frequency. The formula is:\n    \\[\n    OM\\_TO\\_F = \\frac{OM}{2\\pi}\n    \\]\n    This formula is based on the physical relationship between frequency \\( f \\) and angular velocity \\( \\omega \\):\n    \\[\n    \\omega = 2\\pi f\n    \\]\n    Therefore, by dividing by \\( 2\\pi \\), the angular velocity can be converted to frequency.\n  -- END_REGION", "name": "OM_TO_F"}

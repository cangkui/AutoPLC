{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple 2-to-4 decoder functional block named 'DEC_4'. It selects one of four outputs based on two address bits (A0 and A1) and an enable signal (D).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: D (enable signal), A0 (address bit 0), A1 (address bit 1)\n  - Output variables: Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 (four output signals)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Decoding Logic\n  This region implements the decoding logic. Based on different combinations of input signals D, A0, and A1, the corresponding output signal is selected. The specific logic is as follows:\n  - Q0 := D AND NOT A0 AND NOT A1;\n    Q0 is true when D is true and both A0 and A1 are false.\n  - Q1 := D AND A0 AND NOT A1;\n    Q1 is true when D is true, A0 is true, and A1 is false.\n  - Q2 := D AND NOT A0 AND A1;\n    Q2 is true when D is true, A0 is false, and A1 is true.\n  - Q3 := D AND A0 AND A1;\n    Q3 is true when D is true and both A0 and A1 are true.\n\n  This functional block implements the 2-to-4 decoder function through simple Boolean logic, selecting one of four outputs based on different combinations of the two address bits.", "name": "DEC_4"}

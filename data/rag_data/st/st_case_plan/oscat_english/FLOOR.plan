{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function is named `FLOOR`, and its purpose is to calculate and return the 'floor value' of a real number input `X`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `X`. This is achieved by converting `X` to an integer and adjusting the result if necessary.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input real value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   The core logic of this function consists of two steps:\n   1. **Type Conversion**: First, the input real number `X` is converted to an integer, and the result is stored in the `FLOOR` variable. This is done using `REAL_TO_INT(X)`, which truncates `X` to its integer part.\n   2. **Result Adjustment**: Next, the converted integer `FLOOR` is checked to see if it is greater than the original input `X`. If true, it means `FLOOR` is larger than `X`, so `FLOOR` is decremented by 1 to ensure the result is the largest integer not exceeding `X`.\n\n   Finally, the function returns the adjusted `FLOOR` value.", "name": "FLOOR"}

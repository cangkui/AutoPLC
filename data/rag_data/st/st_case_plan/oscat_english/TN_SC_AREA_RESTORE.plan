  "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a functional block named `TN_SC_AREA_RESTORE`, designed to restore character and color data for a screen area. It reads the coordinates and content of the screen area from backup data and restores them to the screen buffer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in_Offset_1`, `in_Offset_2`, `in_Y`, `in_X`, `in_Y1`, `in_X1`, `in_Y2`, `in_X2`. These variables store the coordinates and offsets of the screen area.\n - Output variable: `Xus_TN_SCREEN`, a derived-type variable that stores the screen's character, color, and backup data.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Restore Screen Area\n   - First, check if the first byte of the backup data is greater than 0. If true, it indicates there is a screen area to restore.\n   - Read the starting coordinates (`in_X1`, `in_Y1`) and ending coordinates (`in_X2`, `in_Y2`) of the screen area from the backup data.\n   - Call the `TN_SC_XY2_ERROR` function to validate the coordinates. If invalid, exit without further action.\n   - Set the offset `in_Offset_2` to 5, indicating that character and color data should be read starting from the 5th byte of the backup data.\n   - Use nested `FOR` loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the screen area:\n     - The outer loop iterates through rows (`in_Y` from `in_Y1` to `in_Y2`) and sets the update flag for each row to `TRUE`.\n     - The inner loop iterates through columns (`in_X` from `in_X1` to `in_X2`), reads character and color data from the backup, and writes it to the corresponding position in the screen buffer.\n     - After each write, the offsets `in_Offset_1` and `in_Offset_2` are incremented to point to the next character and color data positions.\n   - After restoration, set the first byte of the backup data to 0, indicating the backup has been processed.\nEND_REGION",

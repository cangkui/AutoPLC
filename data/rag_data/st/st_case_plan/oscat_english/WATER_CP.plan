{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `WATER_CP`, calculates the specific heat capacity (Cp) of water based on the input temperature `T`. It retrieves the Cp value by performing linear interpolation from a predefined data table.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `T`, representing the input temperature value, with a type of `REAL`.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `Pts`, indicating the number of data points, with a type of `INT` and an initial value of 10.\n    - `data`, a two-dimensional array storing the temperature-specific heat capacity relationship. The first column of the array contains temperature values, and the second column contains the corresponding Cp values.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Linear Interpolation Calculation\n    The core logic of the function involves calling the `OSCAT_BASIC.LINEAR_INT` function to perform linear interpolation. This function takes three parameters:\n    1. `T`: The input temperature value.\n    2. `Data`: The data table containing the temperature-Cp relationship.\n    3. `Pts`: The number of data points.\n    The function uses linear interpolation to find the Cp value corresponding to the input temperature `T` from the `Data` table and assigns the result to `WATER_CP`.\n\n- Output Result\n  The return value `WATER_CP` is the specific heat capacity value obtained through linear interpolation based on the input temperature `T`, with a type of `REAL`.", "name": "WATER_CP"}

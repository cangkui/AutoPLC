{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function block named `TREND_DW`, designed to detect the trend of changes in the input DWORD value `X`. By comparing the current value with the previous value, it determines whether the input is rising, falling, or remaining unchanged, and outputs corresponding signals along with the difference value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the current input value (DWORD type).\n  - Output variables:\n    - `Q`: Boolean, indicating whether the input is rising.\n    - `TU`: Boolean, indicating whether the input is rising (same as `Q`).\n    - `TD`: Boolean, indicating whether the input is falling.\n    - `D`: DWORD type, representing the difference between the current value and the previous value.\n  - Internal variable:\n    - `last_X`: DWORD type, used to store the previous input value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function block involves comparing the current input value `X` with the previously stored value `last_X` and setting the output signals based on the comparison result:\n    - If `X > last_X`, it means the input value is rising. Set `TU` and `Q` to `TRUE`, `TD` to `FALSE`, and calculate the difference `D = X - last_X`.\n    - If `X < last_X`, it means the input value is falling. Set `TD` to `TRUE`, `TU` and `Q` to `FALSE`, and calculate the difference `D = last_X - X`.\n    - If `X = last_X`, it means the input value has not changed. Set `TU` and `TD` to `FALSE` and set the difference `D` to 0.\n    Finally, store the current value `X` into `last_X` for use in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block uses simple comparison logic to detect the trend of input value changes and outputs rising/falling signals along with the difference value. It is suitable for scenarios where monitoring data trends is required, such as tracking sensor data or equipment status.", "name": "TREND_DW"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `FILL` that generates a string filled with the input character `C` based on the specified length `L`. The function achieves this through loops and bitwise operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `C` (ASCII code of the character, type `BYTE`) and `L` (target string length, type `INT`).\n  - Internal variables: `i` (loop counter, type `INT`) and `sx` (a single-character string, type `STRING[1]`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization:\n     - First, the input byte `C` is converted into a string `sx` using the `CHR_TO_STRING` function.\n     - The `LIMIT` function is used to constrain the length `L` within a valid range (0 to `STRING_LENGTH`).\n  \n  -- REGION Loop Filling:\n     - A `FOR` loop iterates from `1` to `8`.\n     - In each iteration, the `FILL` string is concatenated with itself using the `CONCAT` function.\n     - The highest bit (7th bit) of `L` is checked. If it is `1`, the character `sx` is appended to the `FILL` string.\n     - The `SHL` function is used to left-shift `L` by one bit in preparation for the next iteration.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result:\n     - After the loop completes, the `FILL` string represents the target string filled with character `C`, with its length determined by `L`.\n     - The function returns the `FILL` string as the result.\n\n- Key Points Explained\n  - The `LIMIT` function ensures the target length `L` stays within valid bounds to avoid overflow.\n  - The `CHR_TO_STRING` function converts the byte `C` into a single-character string.\n  - The `CONCAT` function is used for string concatenation.\n  - The `SHL` function performs bitwise operations, left-shifting `L` to check its highest bit.\n  - Through loops and bitwise operations, the function efficiently generates the target string.\n\n- Summary\n  This function dynamically generates a filled string based on the input character and length using loops and bitwise operations. The code is concise and efficient, making it suitable for scenarios requiring dynamic string generation.", "name": "FILL"}

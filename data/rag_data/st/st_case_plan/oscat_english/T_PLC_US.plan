{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `T_PLC_US`, which converts the PLC's current time into microseconds (μs) and returns the result. If debug mode is enabled, the result can also undergo bit shifting and offset operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code includes the following types of variables:\n  - Constants: `debug` (debug mode switch, default is `FALSE`), `N` (bit shift amount, default is `0`), `offset` (offset value, default is `0`).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (stores the current time).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Time Conversion\n      First, the `TIME()` function is called to retrieve the PLC's current time, which is stored in the variable `tx`. Then, the `TIME_TO_DWORD` function converts the time into a DWORD type, multiplies it by 1000 to convert it to microseconds (μs), and assigns the result to the function's return value `T_PLC_US`.\n  \n  -- REGION Debug Mode Handling\n      If the constant `debug` is `TRUE`, `T_PLC_US` undergoes further processing:\n      1. The `SHL` function shifts `T_PLC_US` left by `N` bits.\n      2. The `SHL` function shifts `DWORD#1` left by `N` bits and subtracts 1 to generate a mask.\n      3. The shifted `T_PLC_US` is bitwise ORed with the mask.\n      4. The result is added to `offset`, and the final value is assigned to `T_PLC_US`.\n  \n  -- REGION Return Result\n      Finally, the function returns the value of `T_PLC_US`.\n\n  The primary purpose of this function is to convert the PLC's current time into microseconds, with support for bit shifting and offset operations in debug mode to meet specific debugging requirements.", "name": "T_PLC_US"}

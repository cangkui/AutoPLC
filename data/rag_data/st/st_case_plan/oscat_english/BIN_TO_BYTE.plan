It reads the binary string bit by bit and constructs the final byte value based on whether each character is '0' or '1'.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: BIN, a string of length 12 representing binary data.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - pt: A pointer to the binary string, used to read the string byte by byte.\n    - i: A loop counter for traversing the binary string.\n    - X: Temporarily stores the ASCII value of the currently read character.\n    - stop: The length of the binary string, used to control the loop iterations.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    First, the pointer pt is set to the starting address of the binary string, and the string length is calculated and stored in the stop variable.\n\n  -- REGION Loop Processing\n    A FOR loop is used to traverse each character of the binary string:\n    1. The ASCII value of the current character is read and stored in X.\n    2. If X is 48 (i.e., the character '0'), BIN_TO_BYTE is left-shifted by one bit (equivalent to multiplying by 2), and the least significant bit is filled with 0.\n    3. If X is 49 (i.e., the character '1'), BIN_TO_BYTE is left-shifted by one bit, and the least significant bit is filled with 1.\n    4. The pointer pt is moved to the next character's position.\n\n  -- REGION Result Return\n    After the loop completes, the converted byte value stored in the BIN_TO_BYTE variable is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Example\n  Suppose the input string BIN is \"1101\". The function processes it as follows:\n  1. Reads the first character '1': BIN_TO_BYTE = 1.\n  2. Reads the second character '1': BIN_TO_BYTE = 3 (1 << 1 | 1).\n  3. Reads the third character '0': BIN_TO_BYTE = 6 (3 << 1 | 0).\n  4. Reads the fourth character '1': BIN_TO_BYTE = 13 (6 << 1 | 1).\n  Finally, the function returns the byte value 13.\n\n- Notes\n  - The function assumes the input binary string does not exceed 12 characters in length.\n  - If the input string contains characters other than '0' or '1', the function will ignore them, which may lead to inaccurate results.\n  - Since a byte (BYTE) can only store 8 bits, if the input binary string is longer than 8 characters, the function will retain only the least significant 8 bits.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `PARITY` used to calculate the parity bit of an input variable `in` of type `DWORD`. The parity bit helps detect errors during data transmission. The function computes the parity bit through a bitwise XOR operation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following variables:\n  - Input variable: `in`, of type `DWORD`, representing the data for which the parity bit is calculated.\n  - Local variable: `PARITY`, of type `BOOL`, stores the final parity bit result.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     - Initialization: `PARITY` is initialized to `FALSE` (default value).\n     - Loop Processing: A `WHILE` loop processes each bit of `in` sequentially.\n       1. The lowest 4 bits of `in` are accessed via `in.0`, `in.1`, `in.2`, `in.3`.\n       2. These bits are XORed with `PARITY`, and the result is stored back in `PARITY`.\n       3. The `SHR` function shifts `in` right by 4 bits to process the next 4 bits.\n     - Termination Condition: The loop ends when `in` becomes 0.\n     - Return Value: `PARITY` is returned as the function's output, representing the parity bit of input `in`.\n\n- Algorithm Flow\n  1. Initialize `PARITY` to `FALSE`.\n  2. Enter a `WHILE` loop, checking if `in` is greater than 0.\n  3. Perform XOR on the lowest 4 bits of `in` and update `PARITY`.\n  4. Right-shift `in` by 4 bits to process the next 4 bits.\n  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `in` equals 0.\n  6. Return `PARITY` as the result.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns a `BOOL` value `PARITY`, indicating the parity bit of input `in`. If `PARITY` is `TRUE`, it means `in` has an odd number of `1`s in its binary representation; if `PARITY` is `FALSE`, it means `in` has an even number of `1`s.", "name": "PARITY"}

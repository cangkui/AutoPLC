  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `CLICK_MODE` is used to detect click patterns in input signals, including single-click, double-click, and long-press. It distinguishes between different click behaviors using a timer and outputs corresponding signals.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `T_LONG` (long-press time threshold, default 500ms).\n  - Output variables: `SINGLE` (single-click signal), `DOUBLE` (double-click signal), `LONG` (long-press signal), `TP_LONG` (rising edge signal for long-press).\n  - Internal variables: `Timer` (timer for detecting long-press), `cnt` (counter to record the number of clicks), `last` (stores the input signal state from the previous cycle).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Timer Logic\n     - Uses the `OSCAT_BASIC.TP` timer to detect long-press behavior in the input signal. The timer's input is `IN`, with a preset time of `T_LONG`.\n     - If the timer hasn't timed out (`timer.Q` is `FALSE`), it means the input signal hasn't reached the long-press time threshold.\n     - If the timer times out (`timer.Q` is `TRUE`), it means the input signal has reached the long-press time threshold.\n\n  -- REGION Click Counting Logic\n     - When the timer hasn't timed out, if the current input signal is low (`IN` is `FALSE`) and the previous cycle's input signal was high (`last` is `TRUE`), increment the counter `cnt`.\n     - If the timer times out, determine whether it's a single-click or double-click based on `cnt`:\n       - If `cnt` is 1, output the single-click signal `SINGLE`.\n       - If `cnt` is 2, output the double-click signal `DOUBLE`.\n     - After the timer times out, reset the counter `cnt` to 0.\n\n  -- REGION Long-Press Detection Logic\n     - If the timer hasn't timed out and the input signal is high (`IN` is `TRUE`), output the long-press signal `LONG`.\n     - If the timer hasn't timed out and the input signal transitions from low to high (`IN` is `TRUE` and `LONG` is `FALSE`), output the rising edge signal for long-press `TP_LONG`.\n\n  -- REGION Store Input Signal State\n     - At the end of each cycle, store the current input signal state into the `last` variable for comparison in the next cycle.\n\n- Output Results\n  - `SINGLE`: Indicates a single-click is detected.\n  - `DOUBLE`: Indicates a double-click is detected.\n  - `LONG`: Indicates a long-press is detected.\n  - `TP_LONG`: Indicates the rising edge of a long-press is detected.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function is named `SHR1` and is designed to perform a signed right shift operation. It takes a 32-bit unsigned integer `IN` and shifts it right by `N` bits, filling the high-order bits with 1s to preserve the sign bit. This function is typically used for right-shifting signed numbers.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the value to be right-shifted; `N` is an integer indicating the number of bits to shift.\n  - Constant variables: `temp` is a 32-bit unsigned integer constant initialized to `16#FFFFFFFF` (i.e., all bits are 1).\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function implements the signed right shift using bitwise operations. First, the `SHL` function is used to left-shift the constant `temp` by `32 - N` bits, generating a mask where the high `N` bits are 1 and the remaining bits are 0. Next, the `SHR` function is used to right-shift the input value `IN` by `N` bits. Finally, the two results are combined using a bitwise OR operation to produce the final right-shifted result.\n  - Detailed steps:\n    1. `SHL(temp, 32 - N)`: Left-shifts `temp` by `32 - N` bits to create a mask where the high `N` bits are 1 and the rest are 0.\n    2. `SHR(IN, N)`: Right-shifts the input `IN` by `N` bits, filling the low-order bits with 0s.\n    3. The two results are combined using a bitwise OR operation, yielding the final result where the high `N` bits are 1 and the remaining bits are the right-shifted value of `IN`.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the result of the signed right shift.\n\n- Example\n  - If `IN = 16#80000000` (i.e., the highest bit is 1 and the rest are 0) and `N = 1`, then:\n    1. `SHL(temp, 32 - 1)` results in `16#80000000`.\n    2. `SHR(IN, 1)` results in `16#40000000`.\n    3. The bitwise OR operation yields `16#C0000000`.\n  - The final return value is `16#C0000000`, representing the result after a signed right shift by 1 bit.", "name": "SHR1"}

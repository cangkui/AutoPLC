{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `BLIND_ACTUATOR`, designed to control a blind actuator. It uses input signals `UP` and `DN` to manage the blind's upward and downward movements, ensuring operational stability and safety through timers and interlock logic. The outputs include the blind's position, angle, status, and current operation state (rising or descending).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `UP` (raise signal), `DN` (lower signal), `S_IN` (status input), `T_UD` (raise/lower time), `T_ANGLE` (angle adjustment time), `T_LOCKOUT` (interlock time).\n - Output variables: `POS` (blind position), `ANG` (blind angle), `QU` (raising status), `QD` (descending status), `STATUS` (current status).\n - Internal variables: `position` (calculates blind position), `angle` (calculates blind angle), `lock` (implements interlock logic).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Interlock Logic\n   The interlock logic is implemented via the `lock` variable to ensure `UP` and `DN` signals do not activate simultaneously. `lock` uses the `OSCAT_BASIC.INTERLOCK` function block, with inputs `UP` and `DN` and interlock time `T_LOCKOUT`. Outputs `lock.Q1` and `lock.Q2` indicate the active states of `UP` and `DN`, respectively.\n-- REGION Angle Calculation\n   Angle calculation is handled by the `angle` variable. `angle` uses the `OSCAT_BASIC.RMP_B` function block, with inputs `lock.Q1` or `lock.Q2` to indicate whether raising or descending is in progress. Timer duration `T_ANGLE` controls the angle adjustment speed. Output `angle.Out` represents the current angle value.\n-- REGION Position Calculation\n   Position calculation is managed by the `position` variable. `position` also uses the `OSCAT_BASIC.RMP_B` function block, with inputs `lock.Q1 AND angle.high` or `lock.Q2 AND angle.low` to ensure position changes only occur after raising/descending operations and angle adjustments are complete. Timer duration `T_UD` controls the position adjustment speed. Output `position.Out` represents the current position value.\n-- REGION Output Assignment\n   Internal variable values are assigned to outputs:\n   - `POS` is assigned `position.Out`, indicating the blind's current position.\n   - `ANG` is assigned `angle.Out`, indicating the blind's current angle.\n   - `QU` is assigned `lock.Q1`, indicating whether a raising operation is active.\n   - `QD` is assigned `lock.Q2`, indicating whether a descending operation is active.\n-- REGION Status Calculation\n   The current status is determined based on input signals `UP` and `DN`:\n   - If both `UP` and `DN` are true, the status is `1`, indicating an error state (conflict).\n   - If only `UP` is true, the status is `121`, indicating a raising operation.\n   - If only `DN` is true, the status is `122`, indicating a descending operation.\n   - If both `UP` and `DN` are false, the status is `S_IN`, maintaining the input state.", "name": "BLIND_ACTUATOR"}

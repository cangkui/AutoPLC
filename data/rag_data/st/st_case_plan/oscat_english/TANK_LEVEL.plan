{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function block written in SCL, named 'TANK_LEVEL', designed to monitor and control tank liquid levels. It determines whether to trigger an alarm or control the valve by detecting the liquid level, leaks, and valve opening duration. The function block also includes status outputs to indicate the current operational state of the system.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `LEVEL` (liquid level signal), `LEAK` (leak signal), `ACLR` (alarm clear signal), `MAX_VALVE_TIME` (maximum valve opening time), `LEVEL_DELAY_TIME` (liquid level signal delay time).\n  - Output variables: `VALVE` (valve control signal), `ALARM` (alarm signal), `STATUS` (status indicator).\n  - Internal variables: `cx` (actuator coil control), `tn` (timer for monitoring valve opening time), `tl` (timer for liquid level signal delay processing), `open` (delayed liquid level signal state).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Liquid Level Signal Delay Processing\n     Uses the `tl` timer to delay the liquid level signal. The `tl` timer's input is the liquid level signal, and the delay time is `LEVEL_DELAY_TIME`. The `open` variable stores the delayed liquid level signal state.\n  -- REGION Alarm Handling\n     If `ALARM` is true, checks whether the `ACLR` signal is true. If `ACLR` is true, clears the alarm, sets the status to `101`, and closes the valve. Then returns immediately without executing subsequent logic.\n  -- REGION Leak Handling\n     If `LEAK` is true, closes the valve, triggers the alarm, and sets the status to `1`.\n  -- REGION Liquid Level Signal Handling\n     If `open` is true (delayed liquid level signal is true), opens the valve and sets the status to `102`.\n  -- REGION Default State Handling\n     If none of the above conditions are met, closes the valve and sets the status to `100`.\n  -- REGION Valve Opening Time Monitoring\n     Uses the `tn` timer to monitor the valve opening duration. The `tn` timer's input is a combination of the valve control signal and `MAX_VALVE_TIME` being greater than 0, with the timing duration set to `MAX_VALVE_TIME`. If the timer times out, triggers the alarm, closes the valve, and sets the status to `2`.\n  -- REGION Valve Control Output\n     Assigns the output value of `cx` to `VALVE` to control the valve's open/close state.", "name": "TANK_LEVEL"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `CSET` for creating a complex number. The real and imaginary parts of the complex number are passed as input parameters, and the function returns a complex structure containing these two values.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `RE` (real part) and `IM` (imaginary part), both of which are of the `REAL` type.\n  - Output variable: `CSET`, which is a complex structure containing two members: `re` (real part) and `im` (imaginary part).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of the function is very straightforward. It directly assigns the input real part `RE` to the `re` member of the complex structure and the input imaginary part `IM` to the `im` member of the complex structure. Finally, the function returns this complex structure.\n\n     ```plaintext\n     CSET.re := RE;\n     CSET.im := IM;\n     ```\n\n  The purpose of this code is to encapsulate the process of creating a complex number, allowing callers to generate a complex number through a simple function call without manually manipulating the structure members of the complex number.", "name": "CSET"}

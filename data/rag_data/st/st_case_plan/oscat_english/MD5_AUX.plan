{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `MD5_AUX`, which serves as an auxiliary function in the MD5 hashing algorithm. The MD5 algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-length (128-bit) hash value for input data. The primary role of the `MD5_AUX` function is to compute an intermediate value based on input parameters, which is then used in the main loop of the MD5 algorithm.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `N`: An integer representing the current operation type (ranging from 1 to 4).\n    - `A, B, C, D`: 32-bit unsigned integers (DWORD), representing the four state variables in the MD5 algorithm.\n    - `X`: A 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD), representing the current 32-bit data block being processed.\n    - `U`: An integer specifying the number of bits for the circular left shift operation.\n    - `T`: A 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD), representing a constant value in the MD5 algorithm.\n  - Internal variable:\n    - `w`: A 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD) used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Operation Selection:\n    Based on the value of the input parameter `N`, the function executes different logical operations. The value of `N` ranges from 1 to 4, corresponding to the four distinct nonlinear functions in the MD5 algorithm:\n    - When `N = 1`, it computes `w := (B AND C) OR (NOT(B) AND D)`. This is the first-round operation in MD5, used to mix the values of `B, C, D`.\n    - When `N = 2`, it computes `w := (B AND D) OR (C AND NOT D)`. This is the second-round operation in MD5, further mixing the values of `B, C, D`.\n    - When `N = 3`, it computes `w := (B XOR C XOR D)`. This is the third-round operation in MD5, using XOR operations to mix the values of `B, C, D`.\n    - When `N = 4`, it computes `w := (C XOR (B OR NOT(D)))`. This is the fourth-round operation in MD5, employing more complex logical operations to mix the values of `B, C, D`.\n\n  -- REGION Result Calculation:\n    After computing `w`, the function performs the following operations:\n    - Adds `A, w, X, T` to produce a new intermediate value.\n    - Applies a circular left shift to this intermediate value, with the shift amount specified by `U`.\n    - Adds the shifted result to `B` to obtain the final return value `MD5_AUX`.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function returns a 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD), representing the computed intermediate value. This value is used in the main loop of the MD5 algorithm to update the state variables `A, B, C, D`, ultimately generating the final 128-bit hash value.\n\nSummary:\nThe `MD5_AUX` function is a critical component of the MD5 hashing algorithm. Based on the input state variables and data block, it generates an intermediate value through various logical operations and circular left shifts. This intermediate value is used to update the MD5 state variables, leading to the generation of the final 128-bit hash value.", "name": "MD5_AUX"}

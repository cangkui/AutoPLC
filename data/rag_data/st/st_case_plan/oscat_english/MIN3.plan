Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a simple SCL function named 'MIN3', designed to calculate the minimum value among three real number inputs. The function achieves this by nested calls to the standard library function `MIN`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one category of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, all of type `REAL`, representing the three real numbers to be compared.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The core logic of this function is very straightforward. First, the `MIN` function is used to compare `in1` and `in2`, yielding the smaller of the two. Then, this result is compared with `in3` using the `MIN` function again, ultimately determining the minimum value among the three inputs. The final result is assigned to the function output `MIN3`.\n\n  Summary:\n  This code employs nested calls to the `MIN` function to compute the minimum value among three real number inputs. The logic is clear, the code is concise, and it is well-suited for scenarios requiring quick identification of the smallest value among multiple inputs.", "name": "MIN3"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `ACTUATOR_PUMP` is used to control the operational logic of a pump. It supports both manual and automatic control modes and ensures that the pump meets the minimum runtime and minimum downtime requirements during startup and shutdown. Additionally, it supports periodic operation functionality and records the pump's runtime and operation cycles.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (automatic control signal), `MANUAL` (manual control signal), `RST` (reset signal), `MIN_ONTIME` (minimum runtime), `MIN_OFFTIME` (minimum downtime), `RUN_EVERY` (periodic operation interval).\n  - Output variables: `PUMP` (pump operation status).\n  - Input/output variables: `RUNTIME` (total pump runtime), `CYCLES` (number of pump operation cycles).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `last_change` (time of the last state change), `meter` (object for recording runtime and cycles), `old_man` (previous state of the manual control signal), `init` (initialization flag).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     On the first run of the function block, the internal variable `init` is set to `TRUE`, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`. If a reset signal `RST` is received, `RUNTIME` and `CYCLES` are reset to 0.\n\n  -- REGION Manual Control\n     If the `MANUAL` signal is true and the pump is not currently running, and the `MANUAL` signal state has changed (from false to true), the pump is started, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`. If the `MANUAL` signal is false and the pump is currently running, and the `IN` signal is false, the pump is stopped, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`.\n\n  -- REGION Automatic Control\n     If the `IN` signal is true and the pump is not currently running, and the minimum downtime `MIN_OFFTIME` requirement is met, the pump is started, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`. If the pump is currently running and the `IN` signal is false, and the minimum runtime `MIN_ONTIME` requirement is met, the pump is stopped, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`.\n\n  -- REGION Periodic Operation\n     If the pump is not currently running and the time since the last state change exceeds the periodic operation interval `RUN_EVERY`, the pump is started, and the current time is recorded in `last_change`.\n\n  -- REGION Runtime and Cycle Recording\n     The `meter` object is used to record the pump's runtime and operation cycles. The input for `meter` is the pump's operation status `PUMP`, and the outputs are `RUNTIME` and `CYCLES`.\n\n  -- REGION Update Manual Control Signal State\n     The current state of the `MANUAL` signal is saved to `old_man` to detect state changes in the next cycle.", "name": "ACTUATOR_PUMP"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `DWORD_OF_BYTE`, which combines four bytes (`B3`, `B2`, `B1`, `B0`) into a double word (DWORD). Through bit shifting and logical OR operations, the four bytes are concatenated in sequence to form a 32-bit double word.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `B3`, `B2`, `B1`, `B0`, all of type `BYTE`, representing the four bytes to be combined.\n  - Output variable: `DWORD_OF_BYTE`, of type `DWORD`, representing the combined double word.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The core logic of the function is to combine the four bytes in sequence into a double word. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Convert `B3` to `DWORD` type and left-shift it by 24 bits (i.e., multiply by 2^24), making it the high 8 bits of the double word.\n    2. Convert `B2` to `DWORD` type and left-shift it by 16 bits (i.e., multiply by 2^16), making it the next high 8 bits of the double word.\n    3. Convert `B1` to `DWORD` type and left-shift it by 8 bits (i.e., multiply by 2^8), making it the next low 8 bits of the double word.\n    4. Convert `B0` to `DWORD` type without shifting, making it the low 8 bits of the double word.\n    5. Use the logical OR operation (`OR`) to merge the above results bit by bit, ultimately forming a complete 32-bit double word.\n\n    The formula is represented as:\n    ```\n    DWORD_OF_BYTE = (B3 << 24) | (B2 << 16) | (B1 << 8) | B0\n    ```\n\n    For example, if the inputs are `B3 = 0x12`, `B2 = 0x34`, `B1 = 0x56`, `B0 = 0x78`, the output double word will be `0x12345678`.\n\n  -- REGION Return Value\n    Finally, the function returns the combined double word `DWORD_OF_BYTE`.", "name": "DWORD_OF_BYTE"}

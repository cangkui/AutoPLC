{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `CACOSH` and is used to calculate the inverse hyperbolic cosine (Inverse Hyperbolic Cosine) of a complex number. It takes a complex number as input and returns another complex number as the result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Local variable: `Y`, used to store intermediate calculation results as a complex number.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Intermediate Results\n     - First, compute the real and imaginary parts of `Y`:\n       - Real part: `y.re := (X.re - X.im) * (X.re + X.im) - 1.0`. This is derived from operations on the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.\n       - Imaginary part: `y.im := 2.0 * X.re * X.im`. This is obtained by multiplying the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.\n     - Then, perform a complex square root operation on `Y`: `y := CSQRT(y)`. This step calculates the square root of `Y`, resulting in another complex number.\n  -- REGION Adjust Intermediate Results\n     - Next, add the real and imaginary parts of `X` to those of `Y`:\n       - Real part: `y.re := y.re + x.re`.\n       - Imaginary part: `y.im := y.im + x.im`.\n     - The purpose of this step is to adjust the value of `Y` to bring it closer to the final inverse hyperbolic cosine value.\n  -- REGION Calculate Final Result\n     - Finally, perform a complex natural logarithm operation on the adjusted `Y`: `CACOSH := CLOG(y)`. This step computes the natural logarithm of `Y`, yielding the inverse hyperbolic cosine value of the input complex number `X`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function calculates the inverse hyperbolic cosine of an input complex number through a series of complex operations. It utilizes complex number addition, subtraction, multiplication, square root operations, and natural logarithm operations. The entire process is clear and efficient, making it suitable for scenarios requiring the computation of the inverse hyperbolic cosine of complex numbers.", "name": "CACOSH"}

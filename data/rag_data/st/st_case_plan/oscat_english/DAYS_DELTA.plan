{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block is named `DAYS_DELTA` and is used to calculate the difference in days between two dates. It takes two dates as input and returns the day difference between them. If the first date is greater than the second date, a negative value is returned; otherwise, a positive value is returned.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `date_1` and `date_2`, representing the two dates.\n  - Output variable: `DAYS_DELTA`, representing the day difference between the two dates.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Date Difference\n     This region contains the core logic of the function block, which calculates the day difference between two dates. First, the code checks if `date_1` is greater than `date_2`. If true, it converts `date_1` and `date_2` to DWORD type, calculates the difference between them, divides the result by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day) to obtain the day difference, converts the result to DINT type, and finally takes the negative value. If `date_1` is not greater than `date_2`, the same calculation is performed, but the result is not negated. The final day difference is then assigned to the output variable `DAYS_DELTA`.", "name": "DAYS_DELTA"}

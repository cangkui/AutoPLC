{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named 'MANUAL_1' that controls the state of an output signal based on input signals. The block supports both manual and automatic modes, and it sets or resets the output signal according to different input signals (such as SET and RST). Additionally, the block uses the state variable `STATUS` to reflect the current operation status.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `MAN` (manual mode), `M_I` (manual input), `SET` (set signal), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output signal), `STATUS` (status byte).\n  - Internal variables: `S_edge` (edge detection for SET signal), `r_edge` (edge detection for RST signal), `edge` (edge detection flag).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Mode Selection and Output Control\n     This region controls the state of the output signal `Q` based on input signals and mode selection, while updating `STATUS` to reflect the current operation.\n     - If `MAN` (manual mode) is false, the output signal `Q` directly follows the input signal `IN`, and `STATUS` is set to 100, indicating automatic mode. Simultaneously, the `edge` flag is reset to false.\n     - If `MAN` is true, and the `SET` signal is true while `S_edge` is false (indicating a rising edge of the SET signal), the output signal `Q` is set to true, the `edge` flag is set to true, and `STATUS` is set to 101, indicating a manual set operation.\n     - If `MAN` is true, and the `RST` signal is true while `r_edge` is false (indicating a rising edge of the RST signal), the output signal `Q` is set to false, the `edge` flag is set to true, and `STATUS` is set to 102, indicating a manual reset operation.\n     - If `MAN` is true and `edge` is false (indicating no edge trigger), the output signal `Q` follows the manual input signal `M_I`, and `STATUS` is set to 103, indicating the default operation in manual mode.\n\n  -- REGION Edge Detection\n     This region detects the edges of the `SET` and `RST` signals to ensure proper handling in the next cycle.\n     - `S_edge` stores the current value of the `SET` signal to detect a rising edge in the next cycle.\n     - `r_edge` stores the current value of the `RST` signal to detect a rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\n  The function block achieves flexible control of the output signal through edge detection and mode selection mechanisms. In automatic mode, the output directly follows the input signal; in manual mode, the output can be set or reset via the `SET` and `RST` signals or directly follow the manual input signal `M_I`. The `STATUS` variable provides information about the current operation state, facilitating debugging and monitoring.", "name": "MANUAL_1"}

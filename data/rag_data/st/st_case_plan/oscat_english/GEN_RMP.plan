{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block, named 'GEN_RMP', is used to generate a ramp signal. It produces a signal that transitions from 0 to 1 over a specified time period, outputting both a real value and a Boolean value based on input parameters.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: PT (Period Time), AM (Amplitude), OS (Offset), DL (Delay Ratio)\n - Output variables: Q (Boolean output, indicating whether the signal is descending), OUT (Real value output, representing the current signal value)\n - Internal variables: tx (current time difference), last (previous timestamp), init (initialization flag), temp (current signal value), ltemp (previous signal value)\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   The function block first checks if it has been initialized. If not, it sets `init` to `TRUE`, records the current timestamp in the `last` variable, and resets `tx` to 0.\n\n-- REGION Time Difference Calculation\n   Computes the time difference between the current time and the last recorded time, storing it in `tx`. If `tx` is greater than or equal to the period time `PT`, it updates `last` to `last + PT` and subtracts `PT` from `tx` to ensure the time difference remains within the period.\n\n-- REGION Signal Value Calculation\n   First, the previous signal value `temp` is stored in `ltemp`. Then, the current signal value `temp` is calculated based on the period time `PT` and delay ratio `DL`. Specifically, `temp` is derived by adding the time difference `tx` to the delay time (`MULTIME(PT, DL)`), dividing by `PT`, and taking the fractional part. Finally, the output signal value `OUT` is adjusted using the amplitude `AM` and offset `OS`.\n\n-- REGION Boolean Output\n   The Boolean output `Q` indicates whether the current signal value `temp` is less than the previous value `ltemp`. If `temp < ltemp`, `Q` is `TRUE`, meaning the signal is descending; otherwise, it is `FALSE`.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block generates a ramp signal by calculating time differences and delay ratios, outputting both a real value and a Boolean value. The Boolean value indicates whether the signal is descending. The core logic revolves around time management and signal value computation, ensuring smooth transitions within the specified period.", "name": "GEN_RMP"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple timer function block `TP_X`, designed to trigger a timer on the rising edge of the input signal `IN` and output `Q` as true for the duration of the preset time `PT`. It also outputs the elapsed time `ET`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` is the trigger signal, and `PT` is the preset time.\n  - Output variables: `Q` is the timer output signal, and `ET` is the elapsed time.\n  - Internal variables: `edge` is used to detect the rising edge of the input signal, `start` stores the timer's start time, and `tx` stores the current time.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Timer Logic\n     - First, `DWORD_TO_TIME(T_PLC_MS())` is used to get the current time and store it in `tx`.\n     - If `IN` is true and `edge` is false (indicating a rising edge is detected), the current time is recorded in `start`, and `PT` is checked to ensure it is greater than `0ms`. If so, `Q` is set to true.\n     - If `Q` is true, the elapsed time `ET` is calculated as the current time `tx` minus the start time `start`. If `ET` is greater than or equal to `PT`, `Q` is set to false, and `ET` is reset to `0ms`.\n     - Finally, the value of `edge` is updated to the current state of `IN` to detect the next rising edge in the following cycle.", "name": "TP_X"}

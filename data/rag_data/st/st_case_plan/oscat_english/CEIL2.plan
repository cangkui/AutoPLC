Natural Language Requirement: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CEIL2`, which performs a ceiling operation on the input floating-point number `X` and returns an integer value. The ceiling operation rounds the input value `X` up to the nearest integer towards positive infinity.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the floating-point number that needs to be ceiling-rounded.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n      1. **Convert to Integer**: First, the floating-point number `X` is converted to an integer type `DINT` using the `REAL_TO_DINT` function, and the result is assigned to `CEIL2`.\n      2. **Check if Ceiling is Needed**: Next, `CEIL2` is converted back to a floating-point number using `DINT_TO_REAL` and compared with the original `X`. If the converted value is less than `X`, it means `X` has a non-zero fractional part, requiring a ceiling operation.\n      3. **Perform Ceiling**: If the above condition is met, the value of `CEIL2` is incremented by 1 to ensure the result is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `X`.\n      4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the value of `CEIL2`, which is the ceiling-rounded result of `X`.\n\n  Through this logic, the function `CEIL2` can correctly handle the ceiling operation for any floating-point number and return the accurate result.", "name": "CEIL2"}

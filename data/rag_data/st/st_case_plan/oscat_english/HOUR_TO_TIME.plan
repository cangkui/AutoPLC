{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `HOUR_TO_TIME`, and its purpose is to convert an input number of hours (of type `REAL`) into a time value of type `TIME`. `TIME` is the standard data type used in Siemens PLC to represent time, measured in milliseconds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variable: `IN`, of type `REAL`, represents the number of hours.\n  - Output Variable: `HOUR_TO_TIME`, of type `TIME`, represents the converted time value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Conversion Logic\n      1. **Convert Hours to Milliseconds**: Multiply the input hours (`IN`) by 3,600,000 (since 1 hour = 3,600 seconds and 1 second = 1,000 milliseconds) to obtain the time value in milliseconds.\n      2. **Convert `REAL` to `DWORD`**: Use the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function to convert the result from step 1 from `REAL` type to `DWORD` type. This is because the internal representation of `TIME` is based on `DWORD`.\n      3. **Convert `DWORD` to `TIME`**: Use the `DWORD_TO_TIME` function to convert the `DWORD` type time value into `TIME` type.\n      4. **Return Result**: Assign the converted `TIME` value to the function output `HOUR_TO_TIME`.\n\n  Example:\n  - If the input is `IN = 1.5`, the calculation process is:\n    - 1.5 * 3,600,000 = 5,400,000 milliseconds\n    - Convert 5,400,000 to `DWORD`, then to `TIME`, and finally return `T#1H30M`.", "name": "HOUR_TO_TIME"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `STAIR`, and its purpose is to perform a stepwise transformation (staircase effect) on the input real value `X`, with a step size of `D`. The stepwise transformation means rounding `X` down to the nearest multiple of `D`. If the step size `D` is less than or equal to 0, the function directly returns `X` without any processing.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `D`, representing the real value to be processed and the step size of the staircase, respectively.\n  - Output variable: `STAIR`, representing the result after the stepwise transformation.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Stepwise Processing\n      This region implements the core logic of the stepwise transformation. First, it checks whether the step size `D` is greater than 0. If `D` is greater than 0, it divides `X` by `D`, converts the result to an integer (rounding down), converts it back to a real number, and then multiplies by `D` to obtain the stepwise-transformed value. If `D` is less than or equal to 0, it directly returns `X` without any processing.", "name": "STAIR"}

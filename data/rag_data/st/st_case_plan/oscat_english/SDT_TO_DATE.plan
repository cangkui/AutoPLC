{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SDT_TO_DATE`, which converts an `SDT` struct (containing year, month, and day information) into a `DATE` type. `DATE` is a data type used in PLC programming to represent dates.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one category of variables:\n  - Input variable: `DTI`, of type `SDT`, representing a struct that holds year, month, and day information.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The core logic of the function is straightforward:\n    1. Extract the year (`YEAR`), month (`MONTH`), and day (`DAY`) values from the input parameter `DTI`.\n    2. Call the built-in function `SET_DATE`, passing the extracted year, month, and day values as arguments.\n    3. The `SET_DATE` function combines these values into a `DATE`-type date and returns it as the function's output.\n    4. Finally, the function returns the converted `DATE`-type value.\n\n    For example, if `DTI` has the values `YEAR = 2023`, `MONTH = 10`, `DAY = 15`, the `SDT_TO_DATE` function will return a `DATE`-type value of `2023-10-15`.\n\n    The primary purpose of this function is to convert structured date information into the `DATE` type commonly used in PLC programming, facilitating subsequent date processing or comparison operations.", "name": "SDT_TO_DATE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `TN_SC_SHADOW_ATTR` that processes an input attribute `Iby_ATTR` of type `BYTE` and returns the processed result. The core logic of the function involves modifying the input attribute through bitwise operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one category of variables:\n  - Input variable: `Iby_ATTR`, representing the input byte attribute.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function processes the input attribute `Iby_ATTR` using bitwise operations. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Use the `AND` operator to retain the upper 4 bits of `Iby_ATTR` (i.e., `BYTE#2#11110000`) while clearing the lower 4 bits.\n     2. Use the `OR` operator to combine the result with `BYTE#2#00001000`, ensuring the 4th bit (counting from the right, starting at 0) is set to 1.\n     3. Assign the final result to the function return value `TN_SC_SHADOW_ATTR`.\n\n   Example:\n   - If the value of `Iby_ATTR` is `BYTE#2#10101010`, then `Iby_ATTR AND BYTE#2#11110000` yields `BYTE#2#10100000`.\n   - Next, `BYTE#2#10100000 OR BYTE#2#00001000` results in `BYTE#2#10101000`.\n   - Therefore, the final value of `TN_SC_SHADOW_ATTR` is `BYTE#2#10101000`.\n\n   Summary:\n   The function's purpose is to retain the upper 4 bits of the input byte, forcibly set the 4th bit to 1, and return the processed byte value.", "name": "TN_SC_SHADOW_ATTR"}

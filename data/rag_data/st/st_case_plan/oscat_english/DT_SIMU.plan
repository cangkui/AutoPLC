{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `DT_SIMU` is used to simulate the increment of date and time (DT). It controls the passage of time based on a specified speed (`SPEED`) by calculating elapsed time and adjusting the output date and time (`DTS`) accordingly.  

- Variable Definitions  
The code defines the following types of variables:  
 - Input variables: `START` (initial date and time), `SPEED` (time passage speed, default is 1.0).  
 - Output variables: `DTS` (simulated current date and time).  
 - Internal variables:  
   - `tc`: Calculated time difference (in milliseconds).  
   - `init`: Initialization flag to indicate whether initialization is complete.  
   - `last`: Last recorded timestamp (in milliseconds).  
   - `tx`: Current timestamp (in milliseconds).  
   - `td`: Adjusted time difference (in milliseconds).  

- Main Logic  
-- REGION Initialization & Time Calculation  
   1. Obtain the current timestamp `tx` and calculate the time difference `tc` from the last recorded time `last` to the current time `tx`, multiplied by the speed `SPEED`.  
   2. If not initialized (`init = FALSE`), perform initialization:  
      - Set `DTS` to the input `START`.  
      - Reset `tc` to 0.  
      - Record the current timestamp `last`.  
      - Set `init` to `TRUE` to mark initialization as complete.  
   3. If the speed `SPEED` is 0.0, directly increment `DTS` by 1 day (simulating time freeze).  
   4. If the calculated time difference `tc` is greater than or equal to 1000 milliseconds (1 second):  
      - Compute the adjusted time difference `td` (in seconds).  
      - Increment `DTS` by the time corresponding to `td`.  
      - Update `last` to `last + td / SPEED` to ensure time passage aligns with the speed.  

-- REGION Output Result  
   Finally, `DTS` is output as the simulated current date and time.", "name": "DT_SIMU"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `MINUTE`, which extracts the minute component from a time-of-day (TOD) variable. The function takes a `TOD` type input and returns an integer representing the minute value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `itod`, of type `TOD`, representing the time of day.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of the function involves converting the `TOD` type time to a `DWORD` type and then performing mathematical operations to extract the minute component. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Convert the `TOD` type time `itod` to a `DWORD` type.\n     2. Divide the converted `DWORD` value by 60000 (i.e., 60 seconds * 1000 milliseconds) to obtain the total minutes elapsed since midnight.\n     3. Divide the converted `DWORD` value by 3600000 (i.e., 60 minutes * 60 seconds * 1000 milliseconds) to obtain the total hours elapsed since midnight.\n     4. Multiply the total hours by 60 to get the total minutes (based on the hour component) elapsed since midnight.\n     5. Subtract the hour-based total minutes (result from step 4) from the total minutes (result from step 2) to obtain the minutes within the current hour.\n     6. Convert the result to an `INT` type and return it.\n\n     For example, if the input time is `12:34:56.789`, then:\n     - Steps 1 and 2 yield `12 * 60 + 34 = 754` minutes.\n     - Steps 3 and 4 yield `12 * 60 = 720` minutes.\n     - Step 5 yields `754 - 720 = 34` minutes.\n     The final returned minute value is `34`.", "name": "MINUTE"}

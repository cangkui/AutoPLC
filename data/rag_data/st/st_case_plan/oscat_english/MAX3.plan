{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple SCL function named 'MAX3', designed to return the maximum value among three input real numbers. It utilizes nested MAX functions to achieve this functionality.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one category of variables:\n - Input variables: in1, in2, in3, all of REAL type, representing the three input real numbers.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   - The core logic of this function is very straightforward, employing nested MAX functions to compare the three input values.\n   - First, the MAX function compares in1 and in2, returning the larger of the two.\n   - Then, this larger value is compared with in3 using the MAX function again, ultimately returning the maximum value among the three inputs.\n   - The final result is assigned to the function's output, MAX3.\n\n- Output Result\n   - The function returns the maximum value among the three input real numbers, with the type REAL.", "name": "MAX3"}

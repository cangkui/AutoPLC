{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `R2_SET`, which returns a value of type `REAL2`. The main purpose of the function is to take an input `X` of type `REAL`, assign it to a member `RX` of the returned structure `REAL2`, and initialize another member `R1` to `0.0`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, represents the input value for the function.\n  - Output Variable: The return value of the function is a structure of type `REAL2`, containing two members:\n    - `RX`: Stores the input value `X`.\n    - `R1`: Initialized to `0.0`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Assignment Logic\n    The core logic of the function is very simple:\n    1. Assign the input value `X` to the member `RX` of the returned structure.\n    2. Initialize the member `R1` of the returned structure to `0.0`.\n    Finally, the function returns this initialized `REAL2` structure.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns a structure of type `REAL2`, where:\n  - The value of `RX` is the input value `X`.\n  - The value of `R1` is `0.0`.", "name": "R2_SET"}

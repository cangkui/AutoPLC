{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block named `CLICK` is used to detect the number of input signal clicks (single, double, or triple) and determine the click type based on time intervals. It employs a state machine to track the number of clicks and indicates the detected click type through output signals and a status byte.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `in` (input signal), `T_debounce` (debounce time), `T_short` (short click time), `T_pause` (click interval time), `T_reconfig` (reconfiguration time).\n - Output variables: `Q` (debounced input signal state), `single` (single-click flag), `double` (double-click flag), `triple` (triple-click flag), `status` (status byte).\n - Internal variables: `s_in` (debounce function block instance), `tx` (current time), `state` (click count state), `last` (time of the last state change).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Input Signal Debouncing\n   Uses the `SW_RECONFIG` function block to debounce the input signal `in`, with debounce time determined by `T_debounce` and `T_reconfig` parameters. The debounced signal is stored in `s_in.Q`.\n-- REGION Get Current Time\n   Retrieves the current time via the `OSCAT_BASIC.T_PLC_MS()` function, converts it to `TIME` type, and stores it in `tx`.\n-- REGION State Change Detection\n   If the debounced signal `s_in.Q` differs from the current output `Q` (i.e., the signal state changes), updates `last` to the current time `tx`. If the signal transitions from low to high (i.e., a click is detected), increments the `state` value (to track the number of clicks).\n-- REGION Update Output Signal\n   Assigns the debounced signal `s_in.Q` to the output `Q`.\n-- REGION Click Count Determination\n   If `state > 0` (i.e., at least one click is detected), determines the click type based on the following conditions:\n   - If the signal is high and the time difference between the current time and `last` exceeds `T_short`, or if the signal is low and the time difference exceeds `T_pause`, the click type is determined by the `state` value:\n     - `state = 1`: Single click, sets `single` to `TRUE` and `status` to `111`.\n     - `state = 2`: Double click, sets `double` to `TRUE` and `status` to `112`.\n     - `state = 3`: Triple click, sets `triple` to `TRUE` and `status` to `113`.\n   Then resets `state` to `0`, indicating the current click detection is complete.\n   If `Q` is low and `state = 0` (i.e., no clicks detected), resets all click flags (`single`, `double`, `triple` to `FALSE`) and sets `status` to `110`, indicating an idle state. Also updates `last` to the current time `tx` and resets `state` to `0`.", "name": "CLICK"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `SECOND`, which aims to extract the seconds from a `TOD` (Time of Day) type time value and convert it into a `REAL` type. The `TOD` type typically represents time in the format `HH:MM:SS.mmm`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one input variable:\n  - `itod`: A `TOD` type variable representing the input time.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Logical Calculation\n      The core logic of the function involves the following steps to extract the seconds from the `TOD` type time:\n      1. Convert the `TOD` type time to a `DWORD` type, resulting in an integer value representing the time.\n      2. Divide the integer value by 60000 (the number of milliseconds in one minute) and take the integer part to get the minutes component.\n      3. Multiply the minutes component by 60000 to get the milliseconds for the minutes part, then subtract this from the total time to isolate the milliseconds for the seconds part.\n      4. Convert the milliseconds for the seconds part to a `REAL` type and divide by 1000 to obtain the seconds value.\n      5. Assign the calculated seconds value to the function output `SECOND`.\n\n      For example, if the input time is `12:34:56.789`:\n      - `TOD_TO_DWORD(itod)` converts the time to an integer representing total milliseconds (e.g., 45296789).\n      - `TOD_TO_DWORD(itod)/60000 * 60000` calculates the milliseconds for the minutes part (e.g., 45240000).\n      - Subtracting this from the total gives the milliseconds for the seconds part (e.g., 56789).\n      - Converting to `REAL` and dividing by 1000 yields the seconds value (56.789).\n\n- Output\n  The function returns a `REAL` type value representing the extracted seconds from the input time.", "name": "SECOND"}

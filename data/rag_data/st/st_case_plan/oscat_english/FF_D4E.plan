{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block `FF_D4E` that implements a 4-bit D flip-flop. It controls the transfer of input signals (`D0` to `D3`) to output signals (`Q0` to `Q3`) based on the clock signal (`CLK`) and the reset signal (`RST`). The function block also includes an edge detection mechanism to ensure triggering occurs only on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `D0` to `D3`: 4-bit input signals.\n    - `CLK`: Clock signal used to trigger the transfer from input to output.\n    - `RST`: Reset signal used to reset the outputs to `FALSE`.\n  - Output Variables:\n    - `Q0` to `Q3`: 4-bit output signals corresponding to the values of `D0` to `D3`.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `edge`: Used to detect the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Reset Logic:\n    If the reset signal `RST` is `TRUE`, all outputs `Q0` to `Q3` are reset to `FALSE`. This is a priority logic, meaning the reset signal overrides all other operations.\n  \n  -- REGION Clock Rising Edge Detection:\n    If the clock signal `CLK` is `TRUE` and `edge` is `FALSE`, a rising edge of the clock signal is detected. At this point, the input values `D0` to `D3` are transferred to the outputs `Q0` to `Q3`. This is the core functionality of the D flip-flop, ensuring outputs are updated only on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n  -- REGION Edge Detection Update:\n    After each logic execution, the `edge` variable is updated to the current value of `CLK`. This mechanism ensures that the input-to-output transfer is triggered only when the clock signal transitions from `FALSE` to `TRUE` (i.e., the rising edge).\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements a basic 4-bit D flip-flop with reset and rising-edge clock triggering. The edge detection mechanism ensures that input values are transferred to outputs only on the rising edge of the clock signal, preventing repeated updates while the clock signal remains high. The reset signal has the highest priority and can reset the outputs to `FALSE` at any time.", "name": "FF_D4E"}

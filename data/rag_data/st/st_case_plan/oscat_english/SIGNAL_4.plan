{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `SIGNAL_4`, which generates an output signal `Q` based on input signals (`IN1` to `IN4`) and predefined byte patterns (`S1` to `S4`). The core logic of the function block involves processing the input signals using a local variable `sig` (of type `SIGNAL`) and ultimately outputting the result to `Q`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN1` to `IN4` are Boolean-type input signals, `TS` is a time-type parameter, and `S1` to `S4` are byte-type initial values (set to `16#FF`, `16#F0`, `16#AA`, and `16#A0`, respectively).\n  - Output variable: `Q` is a Boolean-type output signal.\n  - Local variable: `sig` is a `SIGNAL`-type variable used to process input signals and generate the output.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Input Signal Processing\n    This region processes the input signals `IN1` to `IN4` by invoking the `sig` variable. `sig` is a function or function block whose input parameters include `in` (Boolean, indicating whether processing is enabled), `sig` (byte-type, representing the signal pattern), and `TS` (time-type, representing the time parameter). The specific logic is as follows:\n    - If `IN1` is true, `sig` is called with `S1` as the signal pattern.\n    - If `IN2` is true, `sig` is called with `S2` as the signal pattern.\n    - If `IN3` is true, `sig` is called with `S3` as the signal pattern.\n    - If `IN4` is true, `sig` is called with `S4` as the signal pattern.\n    - If none of the input signals are true, `sig` is called with `in` set to `FALSE`, indicating that processing is disabled.\n\n  -- REGION Output Signal Generation\n    This region assigns the result of `sig` processing to the output variable `Q`. The specific logic is as follows:\n    - The value of `Q` is determined by `sig.Q`, which is the output signal after `sig` processing.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this code is to select different signal patterns (`S1` to `S4`) based on the values of input signals `IN1` to `IN4`, invoke `sig` for processing, and output the result to `Q`. If none of the input signals are true, `sig` is not enabled, and the value of `Q` depends on the default behavior of `sig`.", "name": "SIGNAL_4"}

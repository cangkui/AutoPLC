{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple SCL function named `SIGN_R`, designed to determine whether an input real number is negative. If the input real number is less than 0, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `in`, of type `REAL`, representing the input real value.\n - Return value: `SIGN_R`, of type `BOOL`, representing the function's return value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   The core logic of the function is very simple, consisting of just one line of code:\n   ```plaintext\n   SIGN_R := in < 0.0;\n   ```\n   This line checks whether the input variable `in` is less than 0. If `in` is less than 0, `SIGN_R` is assigned `TRUE`; otherwise, it is assigned `FALSE`.\n-- REGION End\n   The function ends here and returns the value of `SIGN_R`.", "name": "SIGN_R"}

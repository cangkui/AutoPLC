{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `BINOM` to calculate binomial coefficients, i.e., combinations C(n, k). The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. The function optimizes the calculation process to reduce the number of multiplications and improve computational efficiency.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `N` and `K`, representing the total number of elements and the number of elements to choose, respectively.\n  - Internal variable: `i`, used for loop counting.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Parameter Optimization:\n     First, the code checks if the condition `2 * K > N` is met. If true, it replaces `K` with `N - K` because C(n, k) = C(n, n-k), which reduces the computation workload.\n     Next, it checks if `K` is greater than `N`. If true, it returns immediately since the combination number is 0 in this case.\n     If `K` equals 0 or `N`, the combination number is 1, so it directly returns 1.\n     If `K` equals 1, the combination number is `N`, so it directly returns `N`.\n\n  -- REGION Combination Calculation:\n     If none of the above conditions are met, the code proceeds to the combination calculation logic. First, it initializes `BINOM` to `N` and increments `N` by 1. Then, it uses a `FOR` loop from 2 to `K` to iteratively compute the combination value. In each iteration, `BINOM` is updated as `BINOM * (N - i) / i`, ultimately yielding the combination result.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result:\n     After the calculation is complete, the function returns the value of `BINOM`, which is the combination number C(n, k).\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently calculates binomial coefficients by optimizing parameters and reducing multiplication operations. It is suitable for scenarios requiring combination calculations, such as probability theory, statistics, and combinatorics.", "name": "BINOM"}

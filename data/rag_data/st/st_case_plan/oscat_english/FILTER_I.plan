{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a simple digital filter function block named 'FILTER_I'. It takes an input signal X and a time constant T to compute the filtered output signal Y. The core logic of the filter is based on the principle of a first-order low-pass filter, using the time constant T to control the response speed of the filtering.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: X (input signal, type INT), T (time constant, type TIME).\n - Output variable: Y (filtered output signal, type INT).\n - Internal variables: Yi (intermediate calculation value, type DINT), last (previous timestamp, type DWORD), tx (current timestamp, type DWORD), init (initialization flag, type BOOL).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization and Filter Calculation\n   - First, obtain the current timestamp `tx` in milliseconds.\n   - If `init` is false (indicating the first run of the function block) or the time constant T is 0, perform initialization:\n     - Set `init` to true, indicating initialization is complete.\n     - Convert the input signal X to DINT type, multiply it by 1000, and store it in `Yi`. Multiplying by 1000 enhances calculation precision and avoids floating-point operations.\n   - Otherwise, execute the filter calculation:\n     - Calculate the difference between the input signal X and the current output Y, and convert it to DINT type.\n     - Calculate the time difference between the current timestamp `tx` and the previous timestamp `last`, and convert it to DINT type.\n     - Based on the time constant T, compute the filter's response speed. The formula is: `Yi = Yi + (X - Y) * (tx - last) * 1000 / TIME_TO_DINT(T)`. Here, the time difference is multiplied by 1000 to match the precision of `Yi`.\n   - Update `last` to the current timestamp `tx` for use in the next calculation.\n   - Divide `Yi` by 1000 and convert it to INT type to obtain the final filtered output Y.\n\n-- REGION Output Result\n   - Finally, divide the computed `Yi` by 1000, convert it to INT type, and assign it to the output variable Y. This step converts the high-precision intermediate value `Yi` back to the actual output signal range.\n\n- Key Points Explained\n - **Time Constant T**: T determines the filter's response speed. A larger T results in slower response and smoother output signal changes, while a smaller T leads to faster response and output signals closer to the input signal.\n - **Timestamps `tx` and `last`**: By recording the current and previous timestamps, the time difference is calculated to dynamically adjust the filter's response.\n - **Precision Handling**: The code multiplies the input signal and time difference by 1000 to avoid floating-point operations while improving calculation precision. The final output is divided by 1000 to restore the actual range.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block implements a simple yet effective digital filter, suitable for scenarios requiring smoothing of input signals. Through the time constant T, users can flexibly control the filter's response speed to meet various application needs.", "name": "FILTER_I"}

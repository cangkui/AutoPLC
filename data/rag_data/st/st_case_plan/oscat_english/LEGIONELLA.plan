{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function block named 'LEGIONELLA' designed to control a boiler system. It monitors boiler temperature and return water temperature while incorporating time-based control logic to ensure the system operates under specific conditions, preventing the growth of Legionella bacteria. The function block supports both manual and automatic modes and outputs control signals to operate the heater, pump, and multiple valves.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: Manual mode, boiler temperature, return water temperature, date and time, reset signal, start time, day of the week, set temperature, temperature offset, temperature hysteresis, maximum heating time, maximum return water time, and multiple time parameters (tp_0 to tp_7).\n  - Output variables: Heater, pump, multiple valves (valve0 to valve7), operational status, and status byte.\n  - Internal variables: Timer X1, sequence controller x2, hysteresis controller x3, and initialization flag 'init'.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     During the first run of the function block, internal variables and controller parameters are initialized. Specific operations include:\n    - Setting the day of the week and start time for timer X1.\n    - Configuring the low and high thresholds for hysteresis controller x3.\n    - Setting the wait time and delay time for sequence controller x2.\n    - Starting sequence controller x2.\n     These initialization steps ensure the function block has the correct configuration upon startup.\n\n  -- REGION Timer Logic\n     Timer X1 determines whether the start time has been reached based on the input date and time (DT_in) and the configured start time (T_start). If the start time is reached, the output of timer X1 (X1.Q) becomes true.\n\n  -- REGION Control Logic\n     If the output of timer X1 is true, or manual mode is activated, or sequence controller x2 is running, the following logic is executed:\n    - Hysteresis controller x3 determines whether heating is needed based on the boiler temperature (temp_boiler).\n    - The input signal for sequence controller x2 is configured based on the output of hysteresis controller x3 and the return water temperature (temp_return).\n    - The reset signal (rst) for sequence controller x2 is used to reset the controller.\n    - The start signal (start) for sequence controller x2 is triggered by the output of timer X1 or manual mode.\n    - Output signals include the heater (Heat), pump (pump), multiple valves (valve0 to valve7), operational status (run), and status byte (status).\n     If the above conditions are not met, sequence controller x2 is stopped, and the status byte is updated.\n\n  -- REGION Output Logic\n     Based on the results of the control logic, the function block outputs the following signals:\n    - Heater (Heat): Activated when the output of hysteresis controller x3 is false and sequence controller x2 is running.\n    - Pump (pump): Controlled by the output (qx) of sequence controller x2.\n    - Multiple valves (valve0 to valve7): Controlled by the corresponding outputs (Q0 to Q7) of sequence controller x2.\n    - Operational status (run): Determined by the running status (run) of sequence controller x2.\n    - Status byte (status): Determined by the status byte (status) of sequence controller x2.\n\n- Summary\n  The 'LEGIONELLA' function block combines timers, hysteresis controllers, and sequence controllers to automate the control of a boiler system. It automatically or manually controls the heater, pump, and multiple valves based on boiler temperature, return water time, and configured time parameters to ensure the system operates under specific conditions, preventing the growth of Legionella bacteria.", "name": "LEGIONELLA"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `_ARRAY_ABS`, is designed to compute the absolute values of all elements in a real-number array. It accesses the array via a pointer and iterates through the elements to perform the operation.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `pt`: A pointer to a real-number array with a size ranging from 0 to 32000.\n    - `size`: The size of the array, of type `UINT` (unsigned integer).\n  - Local variables:\n    - `i`: An index variable for the loop, of type `UINT`.\n    - `stop`: The loop termination condition, of type `UINT`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - Compute the loop termination condition: `stop := SHR(size, 2) - 1`. Here, the `SHR` (shift right) operation divides `size` by 4 (since each loop iteration processes 4 elements) and subtracts 1 to get `stop`.\n  \n  -- REGION Loop Processing\n     - Use a `FOR` loop to iterate from 0 to `stop` over the array. In each iteration, the `ABS` function calculates the absolute value of the current element and stores the result back in the original array position: `PT^[i] := ABS(PT^[i])`.\n  \n  -- REGION Return Result\n     - After the loop completes, the function return value `_ARRAY_ABS` is set to `TRUE`, indicating successful execution.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently computes the absolute values of all elements in a real-number array via pointer access and stores the results back in the original array. Its concise and high-performance design makes it suitable for processing large real-number arrays.", "name": "_ARRAY_ABS"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function written in SCL, named 'TEMP_NTC', designed to calculate temperature based on the resistance value of an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor. The resistance of an NTC thermistor varies with temperature, and this function computes the corresponding temperature using the given resistance value, nominal resistance value, and B value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: RES (current resistance value of the thermistor), RN (nominal resistance value of the thermistor), B (B value of the thermistor).\n  - Output variable: TEMP_NTC (calculated temperature value in degrees Celsius).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Temperature Calculation\n     This region implements the core logic for temperature calculation. First, it checks whether the input resistance value RES is greater than 0. If true, it uses the following formula to compute the temperature:\n     \\[\n     TEMP\\_NTC = \\frac{B \\times 298.15}{B + \\ln\\left(\\frac{RES}{RN}\\right) \\times 298.15} - 273.15\n     \\]\n     Where:\n     - \\( B \\) is the B value of the thermistor, representing a material characteristic.\n     - \\( RES \\) is the current resistance value of the thermistor.\n     - \\( RN \\) is the nominal resistance value of the thermistor at the reference temperature (typically 25°C, or 298.15K).\n     - \\( \\ln \\) is the natural logarithm function.\n     - 298.15 is the Kelvin value of the reference temperature (25°C).\n     - 273.15 is the offset to convert Kelvin to degrees Celsius.\n     If RES is less than or equal to 0, no calculation is performed, and the function returns a default value (undefined).", "name": "TEMP_NTC"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `V3_XANG`, which calculates the angle (in radians) between a 3D vector and the X-axis. The function takes a 3D vector as input and returns the computed angle.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `A`, of type `Vector_3`, representing a 3D vector.\n  - Internal variable: `la`, of type `REAL`, used to store the vector's length.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Vector Length\n    First, the function `V3_ABS` is called to compute the Euclidean length of the input vector `A`, and the result is stored in the variable `la`. `V3_ABS` is a hypothetical function used to calculate the length of a 3D vector.\n  \n  -- REGION Calculate Angle\n    Next, the function checks whether the vector length `la` is greater than 0.0. If true, it uses the arccosine function `ACOS` to compute the ratio of the X-component of vector `A` (`A.X`) to the vector length. The result is assigned to the function's output `V3_XANG`. The arccosine function `ACOS` returns a radian value representing the angle between vector `A` and the X-axis.\n\n  -- REGION End\n    If the vector length is 0.0, the function performs no further operations and terminates. In this case, the function's return value remains the default (typically 0.0, depending on the programming environment).\n\n- Output\n  The function's output `V3_XANG` is a `REAL` value representing the angle (in radians) between the input vector `A` and the X-axis. If the input vector's length is 0.0, the function does not modify the default return value.", "name": "V3_XANG"}

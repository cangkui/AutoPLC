Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block implements the complex inverse hyperbolic tangent function (CATANH). It takes a complex number as input and returns its inverse hyperbolic tangent value, which is also a complex number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number, consisting of a real part (`x.re`) and an imaginary part (`x.im`).\n  - Internal variables: `i2`, used to store the square of the imaginary part; `num` and `den`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent\n    This region implements the logic for calculating the inverse hyperbolic tangent. First, the square of the imaginary part is calculated and stored in `i2`. Then, the numerator value is calculated using the formula: `num = i2 + (1.0 + x.re)^2`. Next, the denominator value is calculated using the formula: `den = i2 + (1.0 - x.re)^2`. Finally, the real part of the inverse hyperbolic tangent is calculated using the formula: `CATANH.re = 0.25 * (LN(num) - LN(den))`.\n    Subsequently, the imaginary part of the inverse hyperbolic tangent is calculated. First, a new denominator value is calculated using the formula: `den = 1 - x.re^2 - i2`. Then, the imaginary part is calculated using the formula: `CATANH.im = 0.5 * ATAN(2.0 * x.im / den)`.\n  -- REGION Output Result\n    After the calculations are completed, the real and imaginary parts of the `CATANH` variable store the result of the inverse hyperbolic tangent, which is returned as the function's output.", "name": "CATANH"}

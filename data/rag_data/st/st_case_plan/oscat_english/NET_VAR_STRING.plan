{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `NET_VAR_STRING`, designed for transmitting string data over a network. It handles both sending and receiving strings, utilizing a buffer for data exchange. The function block also includes error-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and correctness.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `IN` (input string), `OUT` (output string), `X` (network variable data structure)\n - Output Variable: `ID` (identifier)\n - Internal Variables: `init` (initialization flag), `len_str` (string length), `index` (buffer index), `index2` (auxiliary index)\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This section handles the initialization logic of the function block. If `init` is false, initialization is performed, including incrementing `X.ID_MAX` and converting it to `BYTE` type before assigning it to `ID`. Then, `init` is set to true, indicating initialization is complete.\n-- REGION Data Processing\n   This section manages the logic for sending and receiving data. First, it checks if `X.STATE` is greater than 0 and `X.ERROR_ID` is 0, indicating that data processing can proceed.\n   - If `X.STATE` is 1, data needs to be sent:\n     1. Retrieve the length of the input string, `len_str`.\n     2. Check if the buffer has sufficient space. If not, set `X.ERROR_ID` to the current `ID`.\n     3. If the buffer has enough space, write `ID`, the data type flag (`BYTE#6`), and the string length into the buffer sequentially. Then, call the `OSCAT_BASIC._STRING_TO_BUFFER` function to write the string data into the buffer.\n     4. Update the buffer index `index`.\n   - If `X.STATE` is 2, data needs to be received:\n     1. Verify if the data in the receive buffer matches the current `ID` and data type flag. If not, set `X.ERROR_ID` to the current `ID`.\n     2. If matched, retrieve the string length `len_str` and call the `OSCAT_BASIC.BUFFER_TO_STRING` function to extract the string data from the buffer, assigning it to `OUT`.\n     3. Update the buffer index `index` and auxiliary index `index2`.\n   - Finally, update `X.index` with the current buffer index.\n\n-- REGION Error Handling\n   This section checks for and handles errors during data processing. If the buffer is insufficient or received data doesnâ€™t match, `X.ERROR_ID` is set to the current `ID`, indicating an error.\n\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK", "name": "NET_VAR_STRING"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a simple clock pulse generation function block `CLK_PRG`. Its purpose is to generate a pulse signal `Q` based on the set time interval `PT`. The duration between each pulse output is controlled by `PT`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `PT`, representing the pulse time interval, with a default value of `TIME#10ms`.\n  - Output variable: `Q`, representing the pulse signal, which outputs `TRUE` when the time interval is reached.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `init`: An initialization flag used to indicate whether the function block has been initialized.\n    - `last`: Records the timestamp of the last pulse output.\n    - `tx`: The current time, obtained via the `T_PLC_MS()` function.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    On the first run of the function block, `init` is `FALSE`, triggering the initialization logic. It sets `init` to `TRUE` and calculates the initial value of `last` (current time minus the pulse interval `PT`). This ensures the first pulse output is triggered after `PT` time.\n  -- REGION Pulse Generation\n    The difference between the current time `tx` and the last pulse time `last` is calculated. If the difference is greater than or equal to `PT`, `Q` is set to `TRUE`, indicating a pulse signal trigger. Simultaneously, `last` is updated to the current time `tx` for the next pulse calculation.\n    If the difference is less than `PT`, `Q` remains `FALSE`, indicating the pulse trigger condition has not been met.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block generates a fixed-interval pulse signal by comparing the current time with the last pulse time. It is suitable for scenarios requiring periodic trigger signals, such as timed tasks or periodic state checks. By adjusting the value of `PT`, the pulse interval can be flexibly controlled.", "name": "CLK_PRG"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `SNTP_CLIENT` implements a simple SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) client to retrieve time information from a specified SNTP server. It communicates with the server via the IP protocol and converts the returned time information into a format usable by the PLC.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: `IP_C` (IP control structure), `S_BUF` (send buffer), `R_BUF` (receive buffer).\n  - Input Variables: `IP4` (IP address of the SNTP server), `ACTIVATE` (activation signal).\n  - Output Variables: `ERROR` (error code), `DONE_P` (completion flag), `UDT` (retrieved time information), `XMS` (milliseconds portion).\n  - Internal Variables: `IP_FIFO` (IP FIFO structure), `ip_state` (IP state), `ip_id` (IP ID), `i` (loop counter), `last` (last timestamp), `state` (state machine state), `tx` (current timestamp), `activate_last` (last activation signal state), `ip4_stored` (stored IP address).\n\n- Main Logic\n  The core logic of this function block is a state machine that manages the SNTP request process. Each state of the state machine has specific tasks and logic, detailed as follows:\n\n  -- REGION State Machine\n     - State 00 (Initialization State):\n       - Sets `DONE_P` (completion flag) to `FALSE`, indicating no operation is currently completed.\n       - Detects the rising edge of the `ACTIVATE` signal (i.e., `ACTIVATE` is `TRUE` and `activate_last` is `FALSE`).\n       - If a rising edge is detected:\n         - Stores the input `IP4` (SNTP server's IP address) into `ip4_stored`.\n         - Sets the state machine's state to 10, preparing to send an SNTP request.\n         - Initializes `ERROR` (error code) to 0, indicating no errors.\n         - Sets `ip_state` (IP state) to 1, starting IP layer initialization.\n\n     - State 10 (Prepare to Send SNTP Request):\n       - Checks if `ip_state` is 3. If yes, the IP layer is ready to send the SNTP request.\n       - Fills the send buffer `S_BUF`:\n         - The first byte is set to `BYTE#16#1B`, representing the SNTP request format.\n         - The remaining 47 bytes are set to `BYTE#16#00`, padding the buffer.\n       - Records the current timestamp `tx` into `last` for subsequent time offset calculations.\n       - Sets the state machine's state to 30, preparing to wait for the SNTP response.\n       - Configures the IP control structure `IP_C`:\n         - `C_PORT` is set to 123 (default port for SNTP protocol).\n         - `C_IP` is set to the previously stored `ip4_stored`.\n         - `C_MODE` is set to 1, indicating UDP protocol usage.\n         - `C_ENABLE` is set to `TRUE`, enabling IP communication.\n         - `TIME_RESET` is set to `TRUE`, resetting the IP layer timer.\n         - `R_OBSERVE` is set to `TRUE`, enabling receive buffer observation.\n       - Sets the send buffer size `S_BUF.SIZE` to 48 bytes and the receive buffer size `R_BUF.SIZE` to 0.\n\n     - State 30 (Wait for SNTP Response):\n       - Checks if `IP_C.ERROR` is 0. If not, an error occurred during communication:\n         - Sets `ERROR` to `IP_C.ERROR`.\n         - Resets the send and receive buffer sizes to 0.\n         - Sets the state machine's state to 0, returning to the initialization state.\n       - If `S_BUF.SIZE` is 0 and `R_BUF.SIZE` is at least 48 bytes, the SNTP response was successfully received:\n         - Parses the time information from the SNTP response:\n           - Extracts the timestamp from bytes 40 to 43 of `R_BUF`, converts it to `DWORD` format, subtracts `DWORD#2208988800` (SNTP timestamp base time), and converts it to `DT` format, storing it in `UDT`.\n           - Extracts the milliseconds portion from bytes 44 to 45 of `R_BUF`, converts it to `INT` format, adds the time offset (half of `tx - last`), and stores it in `XMS`.\n           - Adds the seconds portion of `XMS` to `UDT` and updates `XMS` to the milliseconds portion.\n         - Sets the state machine's state to 0, returning to the initialization state.\n         - Sets `DONE_P` to `TRUE`, indicating successful operation completion.\n\n       - If the state machine returns to state 0, it disables IP observation mode `R_OBSERVE` and sets `ip_state` to 4, indicating the request is complete.\n\n  -- REGION IP FIFO Processing\n     - After the state machine executes, calls the `IP_FIFO` function block to handle the IP layer's FIFO queue, updating `ip_state` and `ip_id`.\n\n  -- REGION Activation Signal Handling\n     - After the state machine executes, updates `activate_last` to track changes in the `ACTIVATE` signal state for detecting the next rising edge.\n\n- Output Results\n  The function block outputs include:\n  - `ERROR`: Returns an error code if an error occurs during communication.\n  - `DONE_P`: Set to `TRUE` when time information is successfully retrieved.\n  - `UDT`: Time information from the SNTP server, converted to the PLC's `DT` format.\n  - `XMS`: The milliseconds portion of the time information.", "name": "SNTP_CLIENT"}

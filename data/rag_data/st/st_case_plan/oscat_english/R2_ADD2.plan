{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `R2_ADD2`, is designed to perform addition on two variables of type `REAL2` and return the result. `REAL2` is a structure containing two real-number components, representing the real part and the imaginary part (or another meaning for the second component).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of type `REAL2`, representing the two values to be added.\n  - Output variable: `R2_ADD2`, of type `REAL2`, representing the result of the addition operation.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Addition Operation\n    This region implements the addition of two `REAL2` variables. The specific steps are as follows:\n    1. Add the first component `R1` of `X` to the first component `R1` of `Y`, and assign the result to the first component `R1` of `R2_ADD2`.\n    2. Add the second component `RX` of `X` to the second component `RX` of `Y`, and assign the result to the second component `RX` of `R2_ADD2`.\n    Finally, the function returns `R2_ADD2`, which is the result of adding the components of the two input variables.", "name": "R2_ADD2"}

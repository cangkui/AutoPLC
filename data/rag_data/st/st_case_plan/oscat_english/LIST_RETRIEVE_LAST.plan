{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `LIST_RETRIEVE_LAST`, is designed to retrieve the last element from a string list and remove it from the list. The function locates the position of the last element by searching for a specified delimiter (`SEP`) and returns the element. Simultaneously, it updates the list by removing the last element.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `SEP`, representing the delimiter used to identify the separation points between elements in the list.\n - Input/output variable: `LIST`, representing the string list that stores the elements to be processed.\n - Internal variables:\n   - `i`: An index variable used for looping.\n   - `last`: Records the position of the last delimiter, initialized to 1.\n   - `pt`: A pointer to the string list, used to directly access the list's byte array.\n   - `c`: A temporary variable storing the current character.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   First, the function retrieves the address of the string list `LIST` using `ADR(LIST)` and assigns it to the pointer `pt` to enable direct access to the list's byte array.\n\n-- REGION Finding the Last Delimiter\n   A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through each character in the string list `LIST`:\n   - The current character `pt^[i]` is assigned to the temporary variable `c`.\n   - If `c` is 0 (indicating the end of the string), the loop exits.\n   - If `c` matches the delimiter `SEP`, `last` is updated to the current index `i`, marking a new delimiter position.\n\n-- REGION Returning the Last Element\n   After the loop completes, `MID(LIST, LIST_LENGTH, last + 1)` is used to extract the last element from `LIST` (starting from `last + 1` to the end of the string) and return it as the function's output.\n\n-- REGION Updating the List\n   `pt^[last]` is set to 0, indicating the removal of the last element from the list (i.e., replacing the last delimiter position with a string terminator).\n\n- Output\nThe function returns the last element of the string list and updates the list by removing that element.", "name": "LIST_RETRIEVE_LAST"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block is named 'MATRIX' and is designed to process a set of Boolean input signals (x1 to x5) and generate corresponding output signals (y1 to y4), along with an encoded value (code) and a trigger pulse (TP). Its primary function is to detect changes in the input signals and generate the appropriate encoding and output signals based on those changes.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, Release\n  - Output variables: code, TP, y1, y2, y3, y4\n  - Internal variables: line, X (array), L (array), i, temp\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     TP and CODE are initialized to FALSE and 0, respectively. The input signals x1 to x5 are stored in the current row of array X (determined by the 'line' variable).\n  -- REGION Detect Changes and Generate Encoding\n     A FOR loop iterates through each row of array X to check for differences between the current row and the corresponding row in array L. If a change is detected, an XOR operation is used to identify the specific bit that changed, and the corresponding encoding is generated. The 7th bit of the encoding represents the current state, while bits 4 to 6 indicate the row number. Simultaneously, the trigger pulse TP is set to TRUE. If Release is FALSE and the encoding is less than 127, the encoding and trigger pulse are reset.\n  -- REGION Update Row Number\n     The 'line' variable is updated to the next row number (0 to 3), and the corresponding output signals y1 to y4 are generated through a left-shift operation.", "name": "MATRIX"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block is named `SINH` and is used to calculate the hyperbolic sine function (Hyperbolic Sine). The definition of the hyperbolic sine function is: `SINH(x) = (EXP(x) - EXP(-x)) / 2`. This block takes a real number `X` as input, computes its hyperbolic sine value, and returns the result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, representing the input value for which the hyperbolic sine is to be calculated, of type `REAL` (real number).\n - Output variable: `SINH`, representing the computed hyperbolic sine value, of type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Compute Hyperbolic Sine\n   - First, check if the absolute value of the input `X` is less than `2E-3` (i.e., 0.002). If this condition is met, directly return `X` as the hyperbolic sine value. This is because when `X` is very small, the value of the hyperbolic sine function approximates `X`, and this approximation avoids the computational overhead of complex exponential functions.\n   - If the absolute value of `X` is not less than `2E-3`, compute the hyperbolic sine according to its definition: `SINH(x) = (EXP(x) - EXP(-x)) * 0.5`. Here, the exponential function `EXP` is used to calculate `e^x` and `e^{-x}`, then their difference is taken and multiplied by 0.5 to obtain the final result.", "name": "SINH"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `ERFC`, which calculates the Complementary Error Function. The Complementary Error Function is the complement of the Error Function and is commonly used in statistics and probability theory, particularly in calculations related to the normal distribution.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value for the function.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The core logic of this function is very simpleâ€”it directly calls another function `ERF` to compute the value of the Error Function and then calculates the Complementary Error Function using the formula `ERFC := 1.0 - ERF(X)`. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Call the `ERF(X)` function to compute the Error Function value for the input `X`.\n     2. Subtract the Error Function value from `1.0` to obtain the Complementary Error Function value.\n     3. Assign the result to `ERFC` as the function's return value.\n\n   The primary purpose of this function is to simplify the calculation of the Complementary Error Function, eliminating the need for users to manually call the Error Function and perform the subtraction.", "name": "ERFC"}

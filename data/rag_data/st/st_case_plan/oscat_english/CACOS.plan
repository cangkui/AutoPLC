Natural Language Requirement: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `CACOS` is used to calculate the inverse cosine of a complex number. It achieves this by calling the `CACOSH` function to compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the complex number and then adjusts the result to obtain the inverse cosine value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input variable `X`: A complex number representing the input value for which the inverse cosine is to be calculated.\n  - Internal variable `Y`: A complex number used to store the computed result from the `CACOSH` function.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Inverse Cosine\n     First, the `CACOSH` function is called to compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the input complex number `X`, and the result is stored in the internal variable `Y`. Then, the imaginary part of `Y` is assigned to the real part of `CACOS`, and the real part of `Y` is negated and assigned to the imaginary part of `CACOS`. This way, the `CACOS` function obtains the inverse cosine value of the input complex number `X`.", "name": "CACOS"}

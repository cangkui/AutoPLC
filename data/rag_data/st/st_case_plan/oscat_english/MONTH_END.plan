{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `MONTH_END`, which calculates the last day of the month for a given date. The function takes a date as input and returns the date of the last day of that month.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines an input variable `IDATE` of type `DATE`, representing the input date.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate the last day of the month\n    1. **Extract the year and month from the input date**:\n       - Use `YEAR_OF_DATE(IDATE)` to get the year of the input date.\n       - Use `MONTH_OF_DATE(IDATE)` to get the month of the input date and increment it by 1 to represent the first day of the next month.\n    2. **Construct the first day of the next month**:\n       - Use the `SET_DATE` function to create the date for the first day of the next month in the format `(year, month + 1, 1)`.\n    3. **Convert to DWORD type**:\n       - Use `DATE_TO_DWORD` to convert the first day of the next month into `DWORD` type (representing the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).\n    4. **Subtract one day's worth of seconds**:\n       - Subtract `86400` seconds (equivalent to one day) from the seconds value of the first day of the next month to get the seconds value for the last day of the current month.\n    5. **Convert back to DATE type**:\n       - Use `DWORD_TO_DATE` to convert the seconds value back into `DATE` type, obtaining the date of the last day of the current month.\n    6. **Return the result**:\n       - Assign the calculated last day of the month to `MONTH_END` as the function's return value.", "name": "MONTH_END"}

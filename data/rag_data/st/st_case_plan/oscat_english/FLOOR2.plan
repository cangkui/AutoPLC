{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `FLOOR2` designed to convert an input real number `X` into an integer value rounded down (floor). The function ensures the result is correctly floored by converting the real number to an integer and then checking if the converted integer is greater than the original real number.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the real value to be floored.\n  - Output variable: `FLOOR2`, of type `DINT`, representing the integer value after flooring.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. First, the input real value `X` is converted to an integer value `FLOOR2` using the `REAL_TO_DINT` function.\n    2. Next, `FLOOR2` is converted back to a real value and compared with the original input `X`. If the converted real value is greater than `X`, it indicates rounding up occurred during conversion. In this case, `FLOOR2` is decremented by 1 to ensure the result is correctly floored.\n    3. Finally, the function returns `FLOOR2`, the integer value after flooring.\n\n  The core idea of this function is to guarantee the result is floored through conversion and comparison, rather than simple truncation or rounding.", "name": "FLOOR2"}

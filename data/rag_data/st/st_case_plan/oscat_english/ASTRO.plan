{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in SCL, named 'ASTRO', designed to perform astronomical unit conversions. It takes four input variables (m, AE, PC, LJ) and outputs four results (Ym, YAE, YPC, YLJ) through a series of mathematical operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: m (astronomical unit), AE (astronomical unit), PC (parsec), LJ (light-year).\n - Output variables: Ym (meters), YAE (astronomical unit), YPC (parsec), YLJ (light-year).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Calculation Logic\n   This region contains the core computational logic of the function block, performing the following calculations:\n   1. **YAE Calculation**: Converts the input variables AE, m, PC, and LJ into YAE (astronomical unit) using a weighted summation. The specific formula is:\n      ```\n      YAE := AE + m * 6.6845871535E-012 + PC * 206265.0 + LJ * 63240.0;\n      ```\n      Here, m, PC, and LJ are each multiplied by specific conversion factors to standardize their units to astronomical units.\n   \n   2. **Ym Calculation**: Converts YAE into Ym (meters). The specific formula is:\n      ```\n      Ym := YAE * 149.597870E9;\n      ```\n      This uses a known conversion factor from astronomical units to meters (1 AU = 149,597,870,700 meters).\n\n   3. **YPC Calculation**: Converts YAE into YPC (parsec). The specific formula is:\n      ```\n      YPC := YAE * 4.8481322570E-006;\n      ```\n      This uses a conversion factor from astronomical units to parsecs.\n\n   4. **YLJ Calculation**: Converts YAE into YLJ (light-year). The specific formula is:\n      ```\n      YLJ := YAE * 1.5812776724E-005;\n      ```\n      This uses a conversion factor from astronomical units to light-years.\n\n   Through these calculations, the function block converts the input astronomical units into meters, parsecs, and light-years, then outputs the results.", "name": "ASTRO"}

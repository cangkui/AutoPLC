{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `CPOL`, is used to convert polar coordinates into complex number form. It takes two input parameters: length `L` and angle `A`, and returns a complex number where the real part is `L * COS(A)` and the imaginary part is `L * SIN(A)`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `L` (the length of the polar coordinate) and `A` (the angle of the polar coordinate).\n  - Output variable: `CPOL`, which is a complex structure containing the real part (`re`) and the imaginary part (`im`).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION: Polar to Complex Conversion\n     This region implements the logic for converting polar coordinates to complex numbers. The specific steps are as follows:\n     1. Calculate the real part: `CPOL.re := L * COS(A)`. Here, the cosine function `COS` is used to convert the angle `A` into the real part value.\n     2. Calculate the imaginary part: `CPOL.im := L * SIN(A)`. Here, the sine function `SIN` is used to convert the angle `A` into the imaginary part value.\n     Finally, the function returns a complex number with the real and imaginary parts calculated as above.", "name": "CPOL"}

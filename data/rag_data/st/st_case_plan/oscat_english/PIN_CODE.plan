{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a simple PIN code verification function block named 'PIN_CODE'. It verifies the input PIN code digit by digit. If all digits match correctly, it outputs a signal indicating successful verification.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `CB`: The currently input PIN digit (BYTE type).\n    - `E`: Enable signal (BOOL type), used to trigger the verification logic.\n    - `PIN`: Predefined PIN code (STRING type, length 8).\n  - Output Variables:\n    - `TP`: Verification result (BOOL type). If the PIN verification is successful, it is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `POS`: Current position of the PIN digit being verified (INT type), initialized to 1.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    When the function block executes, the output variable `TP` is first initialized to FALSE, indicating that verification is not passed by default.\n\n  -- REGION Verification Logic\n    If the enable signal `E` is TRUE, the verification logic begins:\n    1. Check whether the currently input PIN digit `CB` matches the `POS`-th digit of the predefined PIN code (obtained via the `CODE(pin, pos)` function).\n    2. If matched:\n       - Increment `POS` by 1 to proceed to the next digit.\n       - If `POS` exceeds the length of the PIN code (`LEN(PIN)`), it means all digits have matched successfully:\n         - Set the output `TP` to TRUE, indicating successful verification.\n         - Reset `POS` to 1 for the next verification.\n    3. If not matched:\n       - Reset `POS` to 1, requiring verification to start over from the beginning.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n    The verification result is returned via the output variable `TP`. If all digits match successfully, `TP` is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block verifies the input PIN code digit by digit, ensuring that all digits match correctly before outputting a successful verification signal. If any digit fails to match during verification, the position is reset, and verification starts over from the beginning. This design ensures the integrity and security of the PIN code.", "name": "PIN_CODE"}

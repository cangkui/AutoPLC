Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `CCOSH` to calculate the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number. The input is a complex number `X`, and the output is also a complex number `CCOSH`, whose real and imaginary parts are computed using the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions, respectively.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Output variable: `CCOSH`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the computed hyperbolic cosine value of the complex number.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating Hyperbolic Cosine\n    The core logic of this function is to compute the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number. The formula for the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number is:\n    \\[\n    \\cosh(z) = \\cosh(x) \\cdot \\cos(y) + i \\cdot \\sinh(x) \\cdot \\sin(y)\n    \\]\n    where \\( z = x + iy \\).\n\n    The specific implementation is as follows:\n    - `CCOSH.re`: Computes the real part using the formula `cosH(x.re) * COS(x.im)`. `cosH` is the hyperbolic cosine function, and `COS` is the cosine function.\n    - `CCOSH.im`: Computes the imaginary part using the formula `sinH(x.re) * SIN(x.im)`. `sinH` is the hyperbolic sine function, and `SIN` is the sine function.\n\n    Through the above calculations, the function returns the hyperbolic cosine value of the complex number.", "name": "CCOSH"}

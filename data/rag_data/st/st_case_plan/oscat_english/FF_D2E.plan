{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block, named `FF_D2E`, implements a simple dual-trigger logic. It has two input signals, `D0` and `D1`, a clock signal `CLK`, and a reset signal `RST`. On the rising edge of the clock signal, the block transfers the values of input signals `D0` and `D1` to output signals `Q0` and `Q1`, respectively. Additionally, when the reset signal is active (true), the output signals are reset to false.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `D0` and `D1` are input signals, `CLK` is the clock signal, and `RST` is the reset signal.\n - Output variables: `Q0` and `Q1` are output signals, corresponding to the values of input signals `D0` and `D1`, respectively.\n - Internal variable: `edge` is used to detect the rising edge of the clock signal.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Reset Logic:\n   If the reset signal `RST` is true, the output signals `Q0` and `Q1` are reset to false. This logic takes priority over clock signal detection, ensuring the outputs are forced to false during reset.\n-- REGION Clock Rising Edge Detection:\n   If the clock signal `CLK` is true and `edge` is false (indicating a rising edge of the clock signal), the values of input signals `D0` and `D1` are transferred to output signals `Q0` and `Q1`, respectively. This ensures the logic only executes on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n-- REGION Edge Detection Flag Update:\n   After each execution of the logic, the value of `edge` is updated to the current value of the clock signal `CLK`. This allows the next execution to compare `CLK` and `edge` to determine if a rising edge has occurred.\n\n- Summary\nThis functional block implements a simple dual-trigger logic that transfers input signal values to outputs on the rising edge of the clock signal and resets the outputs to false when the reset signal is active. The internal variable `edge` detects the clock's rising edge, ensuring the logic executes only at the appropriate moment.", "name": "FF_D2E"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `IP4_DECODE`, which converts an IPv4 address string in dotted-decimal format into a 32-bit unsigned integer (DWORD). An IPv4 address consists of four 8-bit numbers separated by dots (`.`). The function parses the string segment by segment, converts each segment into an 8-bit binary number, and finally combines them into a 32-bit integer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input variable: `str`, of type `STRING(15)`, representing the IPv4 address string in dotted-decimal format.\n  - Internal variable: `pos`, of type `INT`, used to store the position of the dot in the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Parsing IPv4 Address\n    1. **Find the Dot Position**: Use the `FIND` function to locate the position of the first dot in the string and store the result in the `pos` variable.\n    2. **Loop to Parse the String**:\n       - If `pos > 0`, indicating a dot was found, continue parsing:\n         - Use the `LEFT` function to extract the substring before the dot and convert it to an integer using `STRING_TO_DWORD`.\n         - Use the `SHL` function to left-shift the current result by 8 bits, then merge the newly parsed 8-bit number into the result using an `OR` operation.\n         - Use the `DELETE` function to remove the parsed portion (including the dot) from the string.\n         - Use the `FIND` function again to locate the next dot position.\n       - Repeat the above steps until no more dots are found in the string.\n    3. **Process the Last Segment**: When no dots remain in the string, directly convert the remaining substring to an integer and merge it into the result using `SHL` and `OR` operations.\n    4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the parsed 32-bit unsigned integer.\n\n  The core logic of this function involves iteratively parsing each segment of the IPv4 address string, converting each segment into an 8-bit binary number, and combining them into a 32-bit integer. This implementation is suitable for standard dotted-decimal format IPv4 addresses.", "name": "IP4_DECODE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a simple function `LEAP_YEAR` to determine whether a given year is a leap year. The function uses bitwise operations to perform the leap year check.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following variables:\n - Input variable: `yr`, representing the year to be checked, of type `INT`.\n - Output variable: `LEAP_YEAR`, indicating whether it's a leap year, of type `BOOL`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   The core logic of the function uses bitwise operations to determine if the year is a leap year. The implementation is as follows:\n   - The `SHL` (shift left) operation is used to left-shift the year `yr` by 14 bits.\n   - If the result after shifting is 0, `LEAP_YEAR` is set to `TRUE`, indicating a leap year; otherwise, it's set to `FALSE`, meaning it's not a leap year.\n\n   This implementation is based on the mathematical properties of leap years. The rules for leap years are:\n   1. A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4 but not by 100.\n   2. A year is also a leap year if it's divisible by 400.\n   The bitwise operation `SHL(yr,14) = 0` essentially simplifies the check by leveraging these rules in binary form. However, this implementation may not be intuitive or complete. A more common and readable approach would be to use modulo operations directly, for example:\n   ```plaintext\n   LEAP_YEAR := (yr MOD 4 = 0) AND (yr MOD 100 <> 0) OR (yr MOD 400 = 0);\n   ```\n   This method is easier to understand and maintain.\n\n- Notes\nThe current implementation may have issues or lack clarity. It is recommended to use a more straightforward modulo-based logic for the leap year check functionality.", "name": "LEAP_YEAR"}

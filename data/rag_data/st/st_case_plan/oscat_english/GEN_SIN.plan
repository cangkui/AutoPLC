{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function block, named `GEN_SIN`, is used to generate a sine wave signal. It takes cycle time (`PT`), amplitude (`AM`), offset (`OS`), and delay (`DL`) as inputs, and outputs a Boolean value (`Q`) and a real value (`Out`). The sine wave generation is based on the current time and cycle time, while also considering the effects of amplitude, offset, and delay.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `PT` (cycle time), `AM` (amplitude), `OS` (offset), `DL` (delay).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (Boolean value indicating phase inversion of the sine wave), `Out` (real value representing the current sine wave output).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (time difference between the current time and the last recorded time), `last` (last recorded time), `init` (initialization flag), `temp` (temporary storage for the sine value).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - First, calculate the time difference `tx` between the current time and the last recorded time.\n     - Process the delay `DL` to ensure its value is between 0.0 and 1.0. If `DL` is negative, adjust it to 1.0 minus its absolute value.\n     - If `init` is false (i.e., not initialized), perform initialization:\n       - Set `init` to true, indicating initialization is complete.\n       - Set `last` to the current time and `tx` to 0 seconds.\n\n  -- REGION Time Handling\n     - If `tx` is greater than or equal to the cycle time `PT`, update `last` to `last + PT` and reduce `tx` to keep it within the current cycle.\n\n  -- REGION Sine Wave Generation\n     - If the cycle time `PT` is greater than 0 seconds, calculate the sine value `temp`:\n       - Use the `SIN` function to generate the sine wave, with phase determined by `tx` and `DL`, and frequency determined by `PT`.\n     - Calculate the output value `Out`:\n       - Multiply the sine value `temp` by half the amplitude `AM` and add the offset `OS`.\n     - Calculate the Boolean output `Q`:\n       - If `temp` is negative, `Q` is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n- Summary\nThe `GEN_SIN` function block generates a sine wave signal using cycle time, amplitude, offset, and delay, and outputs the current sine wave's real value and phase inversion Boolean value. It uses the time difference and cycle time to calculate the sine wave's phase and adjusts the output range via amplitude and offset. The Boolean output `Q` indicates the phase inversion status of the sine wave.", "name": "GEN_SIN"}

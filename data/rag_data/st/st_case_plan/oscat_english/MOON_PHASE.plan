  "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function block written in SCL, named 'MOON_PHASE', designed to calculate the moon phase for a given date and time (DT). The moon phase is computed using a periodic formula and scaled via input parameters. The function block also supports updating the moon phase value based on a specified time interval (UPDATE).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: XDT (date and time), SCALE (scaling factor, default value is 12), UPDATE (update interval, default value is 60 minutes).\n  - Output variables: PHASE (moon phase value, ranging from 0 to SCALE-1).\n  - Internal variables: x (a 32-bit unsigned integer for storing intermediate calculation results), last_dt (stores the last processed date and time).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The main logic of the function block includes a conditional check to determine whether the moon phase value needs to be updated. The specific logic is as follows:\n    1. First, it checks whether the difference between the current input date and time (XDT) and the last processed date and time (last_dt) exceeds the update interval (UPDATE). If so, the following steps are executed:\n       - Calculate an intermediate value x using the formula: `x := (DT_TO_UDINT(XDT) - 603240) MOD 2551392`. Here, `DT_TO_UDINT(XDT)` converts the date and time to a 32-bit unsigned integer, `603240` is an offset, and `2551392` represents the moon phase cycle in seconds (approximately 29.53 days).\n       - Scale x to the moon phase value using the formula: `PHASE := UDINT_TO_BYTE(SCALE * x / 2551392)`. Here, `SCALE` is the scaling factor, and `UDINT_TO_BYTE` converts the 32-bit unsigned integer to a byte.\n       - Update `last_dt` to the current input date and time (XDT) for future interval checks.\n    2. If the difference between the current input date and time and the last processed date and time does not exceed the update interval, the calculation is skipped, and the current moon phase value remains unchanged.\n\n  This approach allows the function block to dynamically update the moon phase value based on the input time interval (UPDATE), avoiding unnecessary calculations and improving efficiency.",

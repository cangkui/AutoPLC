Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function block named `FT_TN16`, designed to filter input data of type `REAL`. It uses an array of length 16 to store input data and updates the output value at specified time intervals. Each update also triggers a Boolean signal `trig` to indicate the data has been refreshed.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `in` is the input real value, and `T` is the filtering time interval.\n  - Output variables: `out` is the filtered real value, and `trig` is a Boolean signal indicating the output has been updated.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `length` is the fixed array length, set to 16.\n    - `X` is an array of length 16 for storing input data.\n    - `cnt` is the current array index, used for cyclic updates.\n    - `last` is the timestamp of the last update.\n    - `tx` is the current timestamp.\n    - `init` is a Boolean flag for initializing the function block.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization and Time Calculation\n    First, the current timestamp `tx` is retrieved and converted to `TIME` type. Then, `trig` is initialized to `FALSE`, indicating no update has been triggered yet.\n    If `init` is `FALSE`, meaning the function block hasn't been initialized, the input value `in` is stored in the current index position of array `X`, `init` is set to `TRUE`, and the current timestamp `last` is recorded.\n\n  -- REGION Filtering and Update\n    If the function block is already initialized, it checks whether the difference between the current timestamp `tx` and the last update timestamp `last` is greater than or equal to `T / length` (i.e., the time interval per array element). If the condition is met, the following actions are performed:\n    1. Update index `cnt`: If `cnt` reaches the array length minus 1, it resets to 0; otherwise, `cnt` is incremented by 1.\n    2. Assign the value at the current index position in array `X` to the output `out`.\n    3. Store the input value `in` in the current index position of array `X`.\n    4. Update the last update timestamp `last` to the current timestamp `tx`.\n    5. Set `trig` to `TRUE` to signal that the output has been updated.\n\n- Output Results\n  Each time the time interval condition is satisfied, the function block updates the output value `out` and triggers the `trig` signal. `out` is the value at the current index position in array `X`, and `trig` being `TRUE` indicates the data has been refreshed.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements filtering of input data using a fixed-length array and updates the output value at specified intervals. The `trig` signal indicates output updates, making it suitable for scenarios requiring periodic data processing.", "name": "FT_TN16"}

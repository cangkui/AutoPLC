{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function block named `ACTUATOR_COIL`, designed to control the coil of an actuator. It manages the output `OUT` and status `STATUS` based on the input signal `IN`, as well as self-activation cycles and timing. The function block also supports a self-activation feature, where the output is automatically activated according to preset cycles and durations even in the absence of an input signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `self_act_cycle` (self-activation cycle), `self_act_time` (self-activation duration).\n - Output variables: `OUT` (output signal), `STATUS` (status).\n - Internal variables: `last` (last activation time), `init` (initialization flag), `tx` (time difference), `now` (current time).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   During the first execution of the function block, the `last` variable is initialized to the current time, and the `init` flag is set to `TRUE` to ensure subsequent logic executes correctly.\n\n-- REGION Input Signal Handling\n   If the input signal `IN` is `TRUE`, the output `OUT` is directly activated to `TRUE`, and the status `STATUS` is set to `101`, indicating the actuator is in an active state. Simultaneously, the `last` variable is updated to the current time.\n\n-- REGION Self-Activation Logic\n   If the input signal `IN` is `FALSE`, the output `OUT` is first set to `FALSE`, and the status `STATUS` is set to `100`, indicating the actuator is inactive.\n   Next, the time difference `tx` between the current time and the last activation time is calculated. If the self-activation cycle `self_act_cycle` is greater than zero and `tx` is greater than or equal to the self-activation cycle, the output `OUT` is activated to `TRUE`, and the status `STATUS` is set to `102`, indicating the actuator is in a self-activated state.\n   If `tx` further exceeds or equals the sum of the self-activation cycle and duration, the output `OUT` is set back to `FALSE`, and the status `STATUS` is reset to `100`, marking the end of the self-activation process. The `last` variable is then updated to the current time.\n\n-- REGION Conclusion\n   The function block's logic completes, with the output signal `OUT` and status `STATUS` updated according to the input signal and self-activation logic.", "name": "ACTUATOR_COIL"}

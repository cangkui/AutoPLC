{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple function named `V3_NUL` used to determine whether a 3D vector is a zero vector. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input vector is a zero vector.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input variable: `A`, of type `Vector_3`, representing a 3D vector, typically containing three components: `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   The core logic of the function checks whether all three components (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) of vector `A` are equal to `0.0` to determine if it is a zero vector. If `A.X`, `A.Y`, and `A.Z` all equal `0.0`, the function returns `TRUE`, indicating the vector is a zero vector; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n   - Specific Logic:\n     - `V3_NUL := A.X = 0.0 AND A.Y = 0.0 AND A.Z = 0.0;`\n       - This line of code uses the logical AND operator to combine the comparison results of the three components. The expression evaluates to `TRUE` only if all three components equal `0.0`.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function returns a boolean value:\n - If the input vector `A` is a zero vector (i.e., `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are all `0.0`), it returns `TRUE`.\n - Otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.", "name": "V3_NUL"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function called `TRIME` that trims leading and trailing spaces from an input string. It uses loops to check and remove space characters from both ends of the string until no spaces remain at either end.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code uses the following variable:\n  - Input variable: `str`, of type `STRING[STRING_LENGTH]`, representing the input string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Trim Leading Spaces\n     This section uses a `WHILE` loop to check if the first character of the string is a space. If it is, the `DELETE` function removes the first character (the space) and updates the string. The loop continues until no leading spaces remain.\n\n  -- REGION Trim Trailing Spaces\n     This section uses a `WHILE` loop to check if the last character of the string is a space. If it is, the `DELETE` function removes the last character (the space) and updates the string. The loop continues until no trailing spaces remain.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     Finally, the function returns the processed string `TRIME`, which has had all leading and trailing spaces removed.\n\n- Output\n   The function returns the trimmed string with no leading or trailing spaces.", "name": "TRIME"}

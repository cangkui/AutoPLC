Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a simple SCL function named 'MULTIME', designed to multiply a given time value (of TIME type) by a real number factor (of REAL type) and return the resulting time value. The function achieves this by converting the time value to a DWORD type, performing the mathematical operation, and then converting the result back to TIME type.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `t` represents the input time value, of type `TIME`; `M` represents the input real number factor, of type `REAL`.\n - No output variables are defined, as the function result is directly returned via the function name `MULTIME`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic:\n   1. **Type Conversion**:\n      - First, the input time value `t` is converted to `DWORD` type using the `TIME_TO_DWORD` function. This is necessary because `TIME` type cannot be directly multiplied with `REAL` type.\n      - Then, the converted `DWORD` value is further converted to `REAL` type using the `DWORD_TO_REAL` function.\n   2. **Mathematical Operation**:\n      - The converted `REAL` value is multiplied by the input real number factor `M`, resulting in a new `REAL` value.\n   3. **Result Conversion**:\n      - The resulting `REAL` value from the multiplication is converted back to `DWORD` type using the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function.\n      - Finally, the `DWORD` value is converted back to `TIME` type using the `DWORD_TO_TIME` function, which is then returned as the function result.\n   4. **Return Value**:\n      - The function result is directly returned via `MULTIME`, of type `TIME`.\n\n-- REGION End:\n   The function logic concludes, returning the computed result.", "name": "MULTIME"}

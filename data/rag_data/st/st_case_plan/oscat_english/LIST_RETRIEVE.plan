  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `LIST_RETRIEVE` is used to retrieve a substring from a specified position in a string list and return the result. It also updates the input list by removing the retrieved portion. The function block splits the list using a delimiter (`SEP`) and extracts the corresponding substring based on the specified position (`POS`).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `SEP` (delimiter, type `BYTE`), `POS` (position, type `INT`).\n  - Input/output variables: `LIST` (string list, type `STRING`, length `LIST_LENGTH`).\n  - Internal variables: `i`, `o`, `w` (used for loops and indexing, type `INT`), `pt` and `po` (pointers to `LIST` and `LIST_RETRIEVE`, type `POINTER TO ARRAY`), `cnt` (counter, type `INT`), `c` (current character, type `BYTE`).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, the pointers `pt` and `po` are set to the addresses of the input list `LIST` and the output variable `LIST_RETRIEVE`, respectively. The counter `cnt` is initialized to 0 to track the number of delimiters processed.\n  -- REGION Processing Logic\n     If `POS` is greater than 0, the main processing logic begins. A loop iterates through each character in `LIST`:\n     - If the current character `c` is 0 (string terminator), the terminator for the output string `LIST_RETRIEVE` is set to 0, and the terminator for `LIST` is updated based on the relationship between `cnt` and `POS`. The function then returns.\n     - If `cnt` equals `POS` and the current character `c` is not the delimiter `SEP`, the character is copied to the output string `LIST_RETRIEVE`, and the output index `o` is incremented.\n     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `POS`, the current character is copied to a new position in `LIST`, and the write index `w` is incremented.\n     - If `cnt` is less than `POS`, the write index `w` is updated to the current index `i`.\n     - If the current character `c` is the delimiter `SEP`, the counter `cnt` is incremented.\n     If `POS` is less than or equal to 0, the output string `LIST_RETRIEVE` is set to an empty string.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     The function returns `LIST_RETRIEVE`, the retrieved substring.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `DRIVER_4`, designed to manage and control four independent drive units (`DRIVER_1`). The state of each drive unit is controlled by input signals and reflected through output signals. The core logic of the functional block involves instantiating and calling four `DRIVER_1` instances to control each drive and output their states.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - **Input Variables**: Include `Toggle_Mode` (toggle mode), `Timeout` (timeout duration), `SET` (set signal), `IN0` to `IN3` (four input signals), and `RST` (reset signal).\n  - **Output Variables**: `Q0` to `Q3`, corresponding to the output states of the four drives.\n  - **Internal Variables**: `d0` to `d3`, which are four instances of `DRIVER_1`, used to manage the state of each drive.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Drive Control\n    The core logic in this region involves calling the four `DRIVER_1` instances (`d0` to `d3`) to control the behavior of each drive. The input parameters (`Set`, `in`, `rst`, `toggle_mode`, `timeout`) for each `DRIVER_1` instance are passed from the input variables of `DRIVER_4`. The specific logic is as follows:\n    - `d0` to `d3` receive `IN0` to `IN3` as their respective input signals.\n    - The `SET` signal is used to set the state of the drives.\n    - The `RST` signal is used to reset the state of the drives.\n    - `Toggle_Mode` and `Timeout` are used to control the toggle mode and timeout behavior of the drives.\n    - The output state (`Q`) of each drive is mapped to the output variables (`Q0` to `Q3`) of `DRIVER_4`.\n\n  -- REGION Output Mapping\n    This region maps the output states of the four `DRIVER_1` instances to the output variables of `DRIVER_4`:\n    - `Q0` corresponds to `d0.Q`.\n    - `Q1` corresponds to `d1.Q`.\n    - `Q2` corresponds to `d2.Q`.\n    - `Q3` corresponds to `d3.Q`.\n\n- Summary\n  The primary purpose of this functional block is to control four independent drives by instantiating and calling four `DRIVER_1` instances. Input signals (`SET`, `IN0` to `IN3`, `RST`, etc.) are used to control the behavior of each drive, while output signals (`Q0` to `Q3`) reflect the current state of each drive. This design enables `DRIVER_4` to efficiently manage the states of multiple drives and provide a unified interface externally.", "name": "DRIVER_4"}

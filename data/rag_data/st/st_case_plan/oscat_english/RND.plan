{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `RND` that rounds a real number `X` to `N` significant digits. The function calculates an appropriate scaling factor `M`, multiplies `X` by `M` to perform rounding, and then divides by `M` to obtain the final result.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables:\n    - `X`: The real number to be rounded.\n    - `N`: The number of significant digits to retain.\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `M`: The scaling factor, calculated based on the magnitude of `X` and the value of `N`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Handling the case where input `X` is 0:\n     If the input `X` is 0.0, the function directly returns 0.0 since no rounding is needed.\n\n  -- REGION Calculating the scaling factor `M` and performing rounding:\n     If `X` is not 0.0, the following steps are executed:\n     1. Compute the logarithm of the absolute value of `X`, `LOG(ABS(X))`, and take its ceiling value `CEIL(LOG(ABS(X)))` to determine the order of magnitude of `X`.\n     2. Calculate the scaling factor `M` using the formula `M := EXPN(10.0, N - CEIL(LOG(ABS(X))))`. Here, `EXPN(10.0, N - CEIL(LOG(ABS(X)))` represents 10 raised to the power of `(N - CEIL(LOG(ABS(X)))`.\n     3. Multiply `X` by `M`, convert the result to an integer `REAL_TO_DINT(X * M)`, then back to a real number `DINT_TO_REAL(REAL_TO_DINT(X * M))`, and finally divide by `M` to obtain the rounded result.\n\n  -- REGION Returning the result:\n     The computed result is assigned to the function's return value `RND`, and the function terminates.\n\n- Summary\nThe function dynamically calculates the scaling factor `M` to scale the input real number `X` to an appropriate range for rounding, then restores it to the original scale, achieving the goal of retaining `N` significant digits. This method ensures rounding precision while avoiding floating-point precision issues that arise from direct operations.", "name": "RND"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function block named 'BAR_GRAPH,' which outputs corresponding status and alarm signals based on the range of the input value X. The function block supports both linear and logarithmic scale modes and can output different status and alarm signals according to preset trigger values and alarm conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: X (input value), rst (reset signal), trigger_Low (low trigger value), trigger_High (high trigger value), Alarm_low (low alarm enable), Alarm_high (high alarm enable), log_scale (scale mode, True for logarithmic scale, False for linear scale).\n  - Output variables: LOW (low-range signal), Q1-Q6 (mid-range signals), HIGH (high-range signal), Alarm (alarm signal), Status (status byte).\n  - Internal variables: init (initialization flag), T1-T5 (intermediate trigger values).\n  - Temporary variables: temp (temporary storage for calculated values).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n      This region initializes the function block. It first checks if the `init` flag is False; if so, it proceeds with initialization. Based on the value of `log_scale`, it calculates the intermediate trigger values T1-T5. If `log_scale` is True, logarithmic scaling is used; otherwise, linear scaling is applied. After calculation, the `init` flag is set to True to avoid repeated initialization.\n  -- REGION Status and Alarm Signal Reset\n      This region resets the status and alarm signals. First, all mid-range signals Q1-Q6 are set to False, and the status byte `status` is set to 110. Then, it checks if `alarm_low` and `alarm_high` are False; if so, the LOW and HIGH signals are set to False. If the `rst` signal is True, all alarm signals and range signals are reset.\n  -- REGION Status and Alarm Signal Calculation\n      This region calculates the status and alarm signals based on the range of the input value X. First, it checks if X is less than `trigger_low`; if so, the LOW signal is set to True, and the status byte `status` is set to 111. If `alarm_low` is True, the alarm signal `alarm` is set to True, and the status byte `status` is set to 1. If X is greater than or equal to `trigger_low` but less than T1, the Q1 signal is set to True. Similarly, the Q2-Q6 signals are set based on the range of X. If X is greater than or equal to `trigger_high`, the HIGH signal is set to True, and the status byte `status` is set to 112. If `alarm_high` is True, the alarm signal `alarm` is set to True, and the status byte `status` is set to 2.", "name": "BAR_GRAPH"}

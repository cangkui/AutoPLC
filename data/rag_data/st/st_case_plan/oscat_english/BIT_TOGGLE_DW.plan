{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `BIT_TOGGLE_DW`, is used to toggle (flip) the value of a specified bit in a given DWORD (double word) type data. The function takes two input parameters: a DWORD value `IN` and an integer bit position `POS`. It returns a DWORD value representing the result after toggling the `POS` bit in `IN`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN` represents the input DWORD value, and `POS` indicates the position of the bit to be toggled.\n - Return value: `BIT_TOGGLE_DW` represents the DWORD value after toggling the specified bit.\n\n- Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function involves bitwise operations to toggle the specified bit. The steps are as follows:\n 1. Use the `SHL` (shift left) operation to left-shift `DWORD#1` (a DWORD constant with value 1) by `POS` bits, generating a mask. This mask has only the `POS` bit set to 1, with all other bits as 0.\n 2. Use the `XOR` (exclusive OR) operation to perform a bitwise XOR between the generated mask and the input value `IN`. Due to the nature of XOR, the bit in `IN` corresponding to the mask's 1 (i.e., the `POS` bit) will be flipped (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0), while all other bits remain unchanged.\n 3. Return the result of the XOR operation as the function's output.\n\n- Example\nAssume the input `IN` has the value `DWORD#16#0000000F` (binary `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111`), and `POS` is `4`. The function execution proceeds as follows:\n 1. `SHL(DWORD#1, 4)` generates the mask `DWORD#16#00000010` (binary `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000`).\n 2. `DWORD#16#00000010 XOR DWORD#16#0000000F` yields `DWORD#16#0000001F` (binary `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1111`).\n 3. The function returns `DWORD#16#0000001F`.\n\nThis approach allows the function to efficiently toggle any specified bit in a DWORD.", "name": "BIT_TOGGLE_DW"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `MUL_ADD`, which performs a simple mathematical operation: multiplying the input value `X` by coefficient `K`, then adding offset `O`, and finally returning the result. This is a typical linear transformation function, commonly used for scaling and offset calculations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines three input variables:\n - `X`: The input value to be multiplied, of type `REAL` (floating-point number).\n - `K`: The multiplication coefficient, of type `REAL`.\n - `O`: The offset value, of type `REAL`.\nThe function's return value `MUL_ADD` is also of type `REAL`, representing the computed result.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Calculation Logic\nThe function's logic is very straightforward, executing the following operation:\n  ```plaintext\n  MUL_ADD := X * K + O;\n  ```\n  The specific steps are:\n  1. Multiply input value `X` by coefficient `K` to obtain an intermediate result.\n  2. Add the intermediate result to offset `O` to get the final result.\n  3. Assign the final result to the function's return value `MUL_ADD`.\n\n  This logic is often used in linear transformation scenarios, such as converting raw sensor data into engineering units or adjusting signals with scaling and offset in control systems.", "name": "MUL_ADD"}

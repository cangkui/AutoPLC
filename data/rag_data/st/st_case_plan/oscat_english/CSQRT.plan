{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `CSQRT` to calculate the square root of a complex number. The computation is based on the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, derived using mathematical formulas.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number, which includes a real part (`x.re`) and an imaginary part (`x.im`).\n - Internal variable: `temp`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculating the Square Root of a Complex Number\n   1. **Calculate Intermediate Value**:  \n      First, the `HYPOT` function is used to compute the modulus (absolute value) of the complex number `X`. The `HYPOT` function calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of two numbers, as per the formula:\n      ```\n      temp = sqrt(x.re^2 + x.im^2)\n      ```\n      This value is stored in the variable `temp`.\n\n   2. **Calculate the Real Part**:  \n      The real part of the complex square root is computed using the following formula:\n      ```\n      CSQRT.re = sqrt(0.5 * (temp + x.re))\n      ```\n      Here, the `sqrt` function calculates the square root. The formula combines the modulus and the real part of the complex number to derive the real part of the square root.\n\n   3. **Calculate the Imaginary Part**:  \n      The imaginary part of the complex square root is computed using the following formula:\n      ```\n      CSQRT.im = sgn(x.im) * sqrt(0.5 * (temp - x.re))\n      ```\n      Here, `sgn(x.im)` is the sign function, preserving the sign (positive or negative) of the imaginary part of the complex number. The formula combines the modulus and the real part to derive the imaginary part of the square root while retaining the original sign of the imaginary part.\n\n   4. **Return the Result**:  \n      The function ultimately returns a complex number with the real part as `CSQRT.re` and the imaginary part as `CSQRT.im`.\n\n-- REGION End\n   Upon completion, the function returns the computed square root of the complex number.", "name": "CSQRT"}

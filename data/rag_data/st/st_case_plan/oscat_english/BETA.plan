Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `BETA` used to compute the value of the Beta function. The Beta function is an important special function in mathematics, commonly used in probability theory and statistics. Its definition is based on the Gamma function, with the formula:\n\\[\nB(x, y) = \\frac{\\Gamma(x) \\cdot \\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x + y)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Gamma(x)\\) is the Gamma function.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, both of type `REAL`, representing the two parameters of the Beta function.\n  - Output variable: `BETA`, of type `REAL`, representing the computed value of the Beta function.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Compute Beta Function\n    This region implements the computation logic for the Beta function. First, it calculates \\(\\Gamma(X)\\) and \\(\\Gamma(Y)\\) by calling the Gamma function, then divides their product by \\(\\Gamma(X + Y)\\), and finally assigns the result to `BETA`. The specific implementation of the Gamma function is not provided in the code and is typically supplied by a math library.\n\n  -- REGION Return Result\n    Once the computation is complete, the value of `BETA` is the result of the Beta function and is returned as the function's output.", "name": "BETA"}

  "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `FINDB_NONUM`. Its purpose is to search backward from the end of a string to find the position of the first non-numeric character. If a non-numeric character is found, it returns its position; if the entire string consists of digits, it returns 0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the input string.\n  - Internal variables: `pos`, used to track the current position being checked; `pt`, a pointer to a character in the string.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, the pointer `pt` is initialized to point to the last character of the string. This is achieved by calculating the starting address of the string (`ADR(str)`) plus the length of the string (`LEN(str)`) minus 1.\n\n  -- REGION Finding Non-Numeric Characters\n     A `FOR` loop is used to traverse each character backward from the end of the string. The loop variable `pos` decrements from the length of the string down to 1.\n     - In each iteration, the character pointed to by `pt` is checked to determine if it is non-numeric. A non-numeric character is defined as: its ASCII code is less than 48 (i.e., the character '0') and not equal to 46 (i.e., the character '.'), or its ASCII code is greater than 57 (i.e., the character '9').\n     - If a non-numeric character is found, the current position `pos` is returned, and the function exits immediately.\n     - If no non-numeric character is found, the pointer `pt` is moved backward by one position to check the next character.\n\n  -- REGION Returning the Result\n     If the entire string consists of digits, the loop completes, and 0 is returned, indicating no non-numeric characters were found.\n\n- Summary\n  This function efficiently locates the first non-numeric character by traversing the string backward from the end. If the string is entirely composed of digits, it returns 0. The implementation is simple and effective, suitable for scenarios requiring validation of whether a string is purely numeric.",

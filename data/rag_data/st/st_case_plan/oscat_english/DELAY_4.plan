{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a simple delay block `DELAY_4`, which delays the input value `in` by 4 cycles before outputting it. The output values are sequentially passed through `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, and `out4`, with each output delayed by one cycle.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `in`, representing the input real value.\n - Output variables: `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, `out4`, representing the output values delayed by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cycles, respectively.\n - Internal variable: `temp`, used to temporarily store the input value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Delay Logic\n   This region implements the delay functionality. The specific logic is as follows:\n   1. Assign the value of `out3` to `out4`, delaying `out4` by one cycle.\n   2. Assign the value of `out2` to `out3`, delaying `out3` by one cycle.\n   3. Assign the value of `out1` to `out2`, delaying `out2` by one cycle.\n   4. Assign the value of `temp` to `out1`, delaying `out1` by one cycle.\n   5. Assign the input value `in` to `temp` for processing in the next cycle.\n   Through these steps, the input value `in` is sequentially passed to `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, and `out4`, with each output value delayed by one cycle compared to the previous one.\n\n- Output Results\n - `out1`: Output value delayed by 1 cycle.\n - `out2`: Output value delayed by 2 cycles.\n - `out3`: Output value delayed by 3 cycles.\n - `out4`: Output value delayed by 4 cycles.", "name": "DELAY_4"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function named `V3_REV`, designed to compute the reverse of a 3D vector. The function takes a 3D vector as input and returns its reverse vector.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `A`, of type `Vector_3`, representing the input 3D vector.\n  - Output variable: `V3_REV`, of type `Vector_3`, representing the computed reverse vector.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute Reverse Vector\n    The core logic of the function is to compute the reverse of the input vector `A`. The specific operations are as follows:\n    - Negate the `X` component of the input vector `A` and assign it to the `X` component of the output vector `V3_REV`.\n    - Negate the `Y` component of the input vector `A` and assign it to the `Y` component of the output vector `V3_REV`.\n    - Negate the `Z` component of the input vector `A` and assign it to the `Z` component of the output vector `V3_REV`.\n    Finally, the function returns `V3_REV`, which is the reverse of the input vector.", "name": "V3_REV"}

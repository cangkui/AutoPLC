{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function called `AIR_ENTHALPY` to calculate the enthalpy of air. Enthalpy is a thermodynamic property representing the total energy of air, including sensible heat and latent heat. The input parameters are temperature `T` and relative humidity `RH`, and the output is the calculated enthalpy value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `T`: Air temperature (unit: °C).\n    - `RH`: Relative humidity of air (unit: %).\n  - Constants:\n    - `CPL`: Specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure (unit: kJ/kg·K), default value is 1.00482.\n    - `CW`: Specific heat capacity of water at constant pressure (unit: kJ/kg·K), default value is 1.86.\n    - `LH`: Latent heat of vaporization of water (unit: kJ/kg), default value is 2500.78.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Enthalpy Calculation\n    The function's logic is straightforward, directly computing enthalpy based on the formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{AIR\\_ENTHALPY} = \\text{CPL} \\times T + (\\text{CW} \\times T + \\text{LH}) \\times \\text{DEW\\_CON}(RH, T)\n    \\]\n    Where:\n    - `CPL * T`: Calculates the sensible heat component of air, representing the energy corresponding to air temperature.\n    - `CW * T + LH`: Computes the sensible heat and latent heat components of water vapor.\n    - `DEW_CON(RH, T)`: This is a function (assumed to be predefined) that calculates the water vapor content (unit: kg/kg dry air) based on relative humidity and temperature.\n    Finally, the sensible and latent heat components are summed to obtain the total enthalpy of air.\n\n- Output\n  The function returns the calculated air enthalpy value in kJ/kg.", "name": "AIR_ENTHALPY"}

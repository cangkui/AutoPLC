{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `R2_ABS`, which calculates the absolute value of a variable of type `REAL2`. The `REAL2` type is a composite data type containing two real-number components (`RX` and `R1`). The function determines whether negation is required by checking the value of `RX`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL2`, representing the input value for which the absolute value is to be calculated.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic\nThe core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n  - If the `RX` component of the input value `X` is greater than or equal to 0.0, its `RX` and `R1` components are directly assigned to the corresponding components of the output `R2_ABS`.\n  - If the `RX` component of `X` is less than 0.0, its `RX` and `R1` components are negated before being assigned to the corresponding components of the output `R2_ABS`.\n\nThis logic implements the absolute value calculation for the `REAL2` type variable, ensuring that the `RX` component of the output is always non-negative, while the `R1` component maintains the same sign as `RX`.", "name": "R2_ABS"}

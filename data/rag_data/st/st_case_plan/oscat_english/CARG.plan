{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `CARG` that calculates the phase angle (i.e., the argument) of a complex number. The function takes a complex number as input and returns its phase angle in radians.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input variable: `X`, of type `COMPLEX`, representing the input complex number. A complex number typically consists of a real part (`X.re`) and an imaginary part (`X.im`).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate Phase Angle\n   - The core logic of the function uses the `ATAN2` function to compute the phase angle of the complex number. `ATAN2` is a common mathematical function that calculates the angle between the positive real axis and the vector from the origin (0,0) to the point (`X.re`, `X.im`).\n   - The first argument of the `ATAN2` function is the imaginary part (`X.im`), and the second argument is the real part (`X.re`). This parameter order ensures the returned angle is in the correct quadrant.\n   - The result is directly assigned to the function name `CARG`, which serves as the return value.\n\n- Output\n   - The return value `CARG` is a `REAL` type, representing the phase angle of the input complex number, ranging from `-π` to `π`.\n   - For example, if the input complex number is `3 + 4i`, `CARG` will return the result of `ATAN2(4, 3)`, approximately `0.93` radians.", "name": "CARG"}

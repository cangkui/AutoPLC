{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a filter block `FILTER_WAV`, designed to process an input signal `X` through filtering. The core logic involves using a sliding window (`buffer`) of length 16 and a weight array `W` to perform a weighted summation on the input signal, ultimately producing the filtered output signal `Y`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` (input signal), `W` (weight array), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variable: `Y` (filtered output signal).\n  - Internal variables: `init` (initialization flag), `buffer` (sliding window storing the most recent 16 input signals), `i` (current index of the sliding window), `n` (loop counter).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset\n     - If `init` is false (first run) or `RST` is true (reset signal active), initialization is performed:\n       - Set `init` to `TRUE`, indicating initialization is complete.\n       - Initialize all elements of the sliding window `buffer` to the current input signal `X`.\n       - Set index `i` to 15 (the last position in the sliding window).\n       - Directly set the output `Y` to the current input signal `X`.\n     - Otherwise (normal operation):\n       - Use the `INC1` function to increment index `i` by 1, wrapping back to 0 if `i` exceeds 15.\n       - Store the current input signal `X` in the current position `buffer[i]` of the sliding window.\n\n  -- REGION Filter Calculation\n     - Initialize the output `Y` to 0.0.\n     - Perform a weighted summation on the data in the sliding window via a loop:\n       - Starting from the current index `i`, sequentially retrieve data `buffer[i]` from the sliding window and multiply it with the weight array `W[n]`, accumulating the result into `Y`.\n       - Use the `DEC1` function to decrement index `i` by 1, wrapping back to 15 if `i` is less than 0.\n     - Finally, `Y` holds the weighted sum of the sliding window data and the weight array, representing the filtered output signal.\n\n- Key Points\n  - **Sliding Window**: `buffer` stores the most recent 16 input signals, with updates managed via the circular index `i`.\n  - **Weighted Summation**: The core logic of the filter involves summing the sliding window data weighted by the array `W` to achieve the filtering effect.\n  - **Reset Functionality**: When `RST` is true, the sliding window and output are reinitialized, ensuring the filter restarts from its initial state.\n  - **Circular Indexing**: The `INC1` and `DEC1` functions enable circular incrementing and decrementing of the index, ensuring it stays within the 0 to 15 range.\n\n- Summary\nThis block implements a simple sliding window filter that outputs a filtered signal by performing a weighted summation on the input signal. The reset signal `RST` can force the filter to reinitialize, ensuring it restarts from the initial state when needed.", "name": "FILTER_WAV"}

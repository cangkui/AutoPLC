  "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `LIST_NEXT`, is used to extract the next element from a string list. It splits the list using a delimiter (`SEP`) and stores the extracted element in the output variable `LEL`. Additionally, it detects whether the end of the list has been reached and indicates this through the output variable `NUL`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `SEP`: The delimiter used to identify element boundaries in the list.\n    - `RST`: The reset signal used to reset the internal pointer to the beginning of the list.\n  - Input/Output Variables:\n    - `LIST`: The input string list containing multiple elements.\n  - Output Variables:\n    - `LEL`: The extracted next element.\n    - `NUL`: A Boolean value indicating whether the end of the list has been reached.\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `pos`: The current pointer position for traversing the list.\n    - `pt`: A pointer to the input list.\n    - `po`: A pointer to the output list.\n    - `c`: A temporary variable for storing the current character.\n    - `write`: The write position for constructing the output element.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     At the start of the function block, the pointers `pt` and `po` are set to the addresses of the input list `LIST` and the output list `LEL`, respectively. If the reset signal `RST` is true, the pointer `pos` is reset to 1, indicating traversal starts from the beginning of the list.\n\n  -- REGION Detect End of List\n     First, it checks whether the current pointer position `pos` points to the end of the list (i.e., the character is 0) or whether the maximum length `LIST_LENGTH` has been reached. If so, the output list `LEL` is cleared, and `NUL` is set to `TRUE`, indicating no more elements can be extracted.\n\n  -- REGION Extract Next Element\n     If the current pointer position has not reached the end of the list, `NUL` is set to `FALSE`, and the write position `write` is initialized to 1. Then, the list is traversed starting from the next position of the current pointer:\n     - If the current character `c` is the delimiter `SEP` or the list terminator (0), a terminator (0) is written to the current position of the output list `LEL`, and the function block execution ends.\n     - If the current character is neither the delimiter nor the terminator, it is copied to the current position of the output list `LEL`, and the write position `write` is incremented.\n\n  -- REGION End\n     If the entire list is traversed without encountering the delimiter or terminator, the function block ends.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block traverses the input list `LIST` and extracts the next element based on the delimiter `SEP`. It supports resetting the traversal pointer via the reset signal `RST` and indicates whether the end of the list has been reached through the output variable `NUL`. The extracted element is stored in the output variable `LEL`.",

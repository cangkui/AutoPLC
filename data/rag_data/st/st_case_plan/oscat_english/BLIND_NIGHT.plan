{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named `BLIND_NIGHT`, which controls the behavior of blinds during the day and night. Based on input time, sunrise/sunset times, and offset values, the block determines whether it is currently day or night and adjusts the blinds' position and angle accordingly.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables: Include blind raise (UP) and lower (DN) signals, input state (S_IN), input position (PI), input angle (AI), night enable (E_NIGHT), day enable (E_DAY), current time (DTIN), sunrise time (SUNRISE), sunset time (SUNSET), sunrise offset (SUNRISE_OFFSET), sunset offset (SUNSET_OFFSET), night position (NIGHT_POSITION), and night angle (NIGHT_ANGLE).\n  - Output Variables: Include blind raise output (QU), lower output (QD), state (STATUS), output position (PO), and output angle (AO).\n  - Internal Variables: Include whether it is currently night (night), the last date night mode was entered (last_night), and the last date day mode was entered (last_day).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Night Detection Logic\n    This section determines whether it is currently night based on the current time, sunrise/sunset times, and offsets, then updates the relevant states.\n    - If the current time is later than sunset time plus sunset offset, the last night entry date is earlier than the current date, and night enable (E_NIGHT) is TRUE, then set `night` to `TRUE` and update `last_night` to the current date.\n    - If the current time is later than sunrise time plus sunrise offset, the last day entry date is earlier than the current date, day enable (E_DAY) is TRUE, and the last night entry date is earlier than the current date, then set `night` to `FALSE` and update `last_day` to the current date.\n    - If both `UP` and `DN` are `FALSE` and `night` is `TRUE`, set `night` to `FALSE`.\n\n  -- REGION Blind Control Logic\n    This section adjusts the blinds' position, angle, and state based on whether it is night and the input signals.\n    - If both `UP` and `DN` are `TRUE` and `night` is `TRUE`, set the state (STATUS) to 141, output position (PO) to night position (NIGHT_POSITION), and output angle (AO) to night angle (NIGHT_ANGLE).\n    - Otherwise, set raise output (QU) to `UP`, lower output (QD) to `DN`, output position (PO) to input position (PI), output angle (AO) to input angle (AI), and state (STATUS) to input state (S_IN).", "name": "BLIND_NIGHT"}

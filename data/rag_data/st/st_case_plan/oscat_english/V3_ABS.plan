{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function `V3_ABS` designed to calculate the magnitude (length) of a 3D vector. The function takes an array of three real numbers (`REAL`) as input, representing the three components (X, Y, Z) of the vector, and returns its magnitude.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The following variables are defined in the code:\n  - Input variable: `A`, an array of three real numbers (`REAL`), representing the three components (X, Y, Z) of the 3D vector.\n  - Return value: `V3_ABS`, a real number (`REAL`), representing the calculated magnitude of the vector.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Vector Magnitude\n    The core logic of the function computes the magnitude of the 3D vector using the formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{V3\\_ABS} = \\sqrt{A[1]^2 + A[2]^2 + A[3]^2}\n    \\]\n    Where:\n    - \\(A[1]\\) represents the X component of the vector.\n    - \\(A[2]\\) represents the Y component of the vector.\n    - \\(A[3]\\) represents the Z component of the vector.\n    The code calculates the square root by calling the `SQRT` function and assigns the result to `V3_ABS`.\n\n  -- REGION Return Value\n    Upon completion, the function returns the calculated vector magnitude `V3_ABS`.\n\n- Output\n  The output of the function is the magnitude of the 3D vector, i.e., the value of `V3_ABS`. This value can be directly used for subsequent calculations or logical processing.", "name": "V3_ABS"}

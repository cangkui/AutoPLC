Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `MINUTE_TO_TIME` that converts an input value in minutes (represented as `REAL` type) into a `TIME` type value. The `TIME` type in PLC programming is typically used to represent time in milliseconds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one category of variables:\n - Input variable: `IN`, of type `REAL`, representing the input value in minutes.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Conversion Logic:\n   The function's logic is straightforward and consists of the following steps:\n   1. Multiply the input minutes (`IN`) by `60000.0` to convert it into milliseconds (since 1 minute = 60000 milliseconds).\n   2. Use the `REAL_TO_DWORD` function to convert the result from `REAL` type to `DWORD` type, as the underlying representation of `TIME` is `DWORD`.\n   3. Use the `DWORD_TO_TIME` function to convert the `DWORD` type value into `TIME` type.\n   4. Finally, the function returns the converted `TIME` value.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a `TIME` type value representing the input minutes converted into time (in milliseconds).", "name": "MINUTE_TO_TIME"}

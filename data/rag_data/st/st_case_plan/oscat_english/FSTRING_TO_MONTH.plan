{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `FSTRING_TO_MONTH`, is designed to convert a string representing a month into its corresponding numeric value (1 to 12). It supports multiple languages and selects the appropriate month names or abbreviations for comparison based on the input language code.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `MTH` (the string representing the month), `LANG` (the language code).\n  - Internal variables: `lx` (a temporary variable for storing the language code).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Language Code Handling\n    First, the temporary variable `lx` is set based on the input language code `LANG`. If `LANG` is 0, the default language code is used; otherwise, the smaller value between `LANG` and `LANGUAGE.LMAX` is used to ensure the language code is within a valid range.\n  \n  -- REGION String Processing\n    The input month string `MTH` is processed as follows:\n    - The `TRIM` function removes leading and trailing spaces from the string.\n    - The `LOWERCASE` function converts the string to lowercase.\n    - The `CAPITALIZE` function capitalizes the first letter of the string.\n\n  -- REGION Month Matching\n    A `FOR` loop iterates from 1 to 12, comparing the string with the corresponding month names or abbreviations in the selected language:\n    - If `MTH` matches `language.MONTHS[lx, FSTRING_TO_MONTH]` (full month name), the current month number is returned.\n    - If `MTH` matches `language.MONTHS3[lx, FSTRING_TO_MONTH]` (month abbreviation), the current month number is returned.\n    If no match is found after the loop completes, `MTH` is directly converted to an integer and returned.\n\n  -- REGION Result Return\n    If the input string is neither a month name nor an abbreviation, the function attempts to convert it directly to an integer and return the result. If the conversion fails, the function returns 0 or another default value (depending on the implementation of `STRING_TO_INT`).", "name": "FSTRING_TO_MONTH"}

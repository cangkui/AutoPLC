{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This functional block is named 'CSV_PARSER_FILE' and is used to parse CSV files. It reads data from a specified file and parses it into strings (VALUE) based on a given delimiter (SEP). The block controls the parsing process via a state machine and outputs corresponding status codes (RESULT) based on the parsing results.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: SEP (delimiter).\n  - Input/output variables: FILENAME (file name), FSD (file server data), RUN (run flag), OFFSET (file offset), VALUE (parsed string), PT (network buffer).\n  - Output variables: RESULT (parsing result status code).\n  - Internal variables: i (file offset counter), state (state machine status), e (error code), mode (file operation mode), step (step counter), c (current character), v_add (character to be added), eof (end-of-file flag), pv (pointer to VALUE), pve (end pointer of VALUE), watchdog (watchdog timer), x (temporary flag), FB (file operation functional block).\n\n- - Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n    When RUN > 0, the block starts working. First, it checks if the state is 0 (initial state). If so, it initializes the relevant variables:\n    - Sets the pointer pv to the start of VALUE and clears VALUE (sets the first byte to 0).\n    - Sets the file offset i to OFFSET, indicating the starting position for reading the file.\n    - Sets RESULT to 0, indicating parsing is not yet complete.\n    - Sets the state to 5, indicating entry into the parsing state.\n    - Sets step to 0, indicating parsing starts from the first step.\n    Then, it starts the watchdog timer to monitor for parsing timeouts.\n\n  -- REGION Parsing Loop\n    When the state is 5, the parsing loop begins. The core logic of the loop is as follows:\n    1. Sets the file operation mode to 1 (read mode) and calls the file operation block FB to read file content. FB reads one byte of data from the file, stores the result in variable c, and updates the error code e.\n    2. Checks if the file offset i + 1 equals the file size FSD.FILE_SIZE. If true, sets eof to TRUE, indicating the end of the file.\n    3. Calls the watchdog timer to check for timeouts or invalid file operation modes. If a timeout or invalid mode occurs, the state remains 5, and the loop exits.\n    4. If a file operation error occurs (e > 0), sets the state to 10 (error state) and exits the loop.\n    5. If the file operation succeeds, processes the current character c as follows:\n       - If c equals the delimiter SEP, the current field ends, sets the state to 1 (parsing complete), and sets the temporary flag x to TRUE.\n       - If c is a valid character (c >= 32, i.e., non-control character), assigns c to v_add. If the file ends (eof), sets the state to 2 (parsing complete and file ended); otherwise, sets the temporary flag x to TRUE.\n       - If c is an invalid character (e.g., newline or control character) and the temporary flag x is TRUE, sets the state to 2 (parsing complete and file ended) and clears the temporary flag x.\n    6. If v_add is valid and the pointer pv does not exceed the end pointer pve of VALUE, adds v_add to VALUE and updates the pointer pv. This gradually builds the parsed string in VALUE.\n    7. Increments the file offset i to continue reading the next byte of the file.\n\n  -- REGION State Handling\n    Based on the state value, the following actions are performed:\n    - State 1: Parsing is complete, and the file has not ended. Sets RESULT to 1, updates OFFSET to i (the next parsing starting position), sets RUN to 0 (stop running), and resets the state to 0 (initial state).\n    - State 2: Parsing is complete, and the file has ended. Sets RESULT to 2, updates OFFSET to i, sets RUN to 0 (stop running), and resets the state to 0 (initial state).\n    - State 5: Parsing is still in progress. Sets RESULT to 5, indicating the block is still parsing the file.\n    - State 10: An error occurred during parsing. Sets RESULT to 10, updates OFFSET to i, sets RUN to 0 (stop running), and resets the state to 0 (initial state).\n\n  -- REGION Watchdog Timer\n    The watchdog timer monitors the parsing process for timeouts. If the parsing takes too long, the watchdog triggers (watchdog.Q is TRUE), forcing the loop to exit while keeping the state at 5. This prevents the block from entering an infinite loop due to abnormal conditions.\n\n  -- REGION File Operation Block (FB)\n    The file operation block FB is used to read data from the file. Based on the mode value, it performs different operations (e.g., read, write). In this block, mode is always 1 (read mode), meaning it reads one byte of data from the file. The result is stored in variable c, and the error code is stored in variable e. If the operation succeeds, e is 0; otherwise, e is non-zero, indicating an error.\n\n  -- REGION Pointer Operations\n    The pointer pv is used to add characters to VALUE. After reading a valid character, it adds the character to VALUE and updates the pointer pv. If pv exceeds the end pointer pve of VALUE, no more characters are added to prevent overflow.\n\n  -- REGION File Offset Management\n    The file offset i records the current read position. After reading each byte, i increments by 1 to continue reading the next byte. After parsing completes, i is updated to OFFSET to ensure the next parsing starts from the correct position.\n\n  -- REGION Temporary Flag x\n    The temporary flag x records whether a valid character has been read. If an invalid character (e.g., control character) is read and x is TRUE, it indicates the current field has ended, and the state is set to 2 (parsing complete and file ended).", "name": "CSV_PARSER_FILE"}

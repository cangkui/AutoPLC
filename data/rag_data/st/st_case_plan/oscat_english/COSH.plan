Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `COSH` to calculate the hyperbolic cosine of an input value `X`. The mathematical definition of the hyperbolic cosine function is `COSH(X) = (e^X + e^(-X)) / 2`, where `e` is the base of the natural logarithm. The function computes the hyperbolic cosine value using the exponential function `EXP(X)`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `X`, representing the real number for which the hyperbolic cosine is to be calculated.\n - Internal variable: `t`, used to temporarily store the result of the exponential function `EXP(X)`.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate Hyperbolic Cosine\n   - First, compute `t = EXP(X)`, which is the value of `e^X`.\n   - Then, based on the hyperbolic cosine formula, calculate `COSH = (1.0 / t + t) * 0.5`. Here, `1.0 / t` represents `e^(-X)`, and `t` represents `e^X`. Adding them together and dividing by 2 yields the final hyperbolic cosine value.\n   - Finally, the function returns the computed `COSH` value.\n\nThis code is very concise and directly implements the mathematical definition of hyperbolic cosine, using the exponential function `EXP(X)` to complete the calculation.", "name": "COSH"}

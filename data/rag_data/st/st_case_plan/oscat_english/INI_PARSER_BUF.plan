{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code is a function block written in SCL, named 'INI_PARSER_BUF', designed to parse buffer data in INI file format. It extracts key-value pairs from the buffer and returns parsing results based on input conditions. The function block supports multiple operation modes to handle different parsing scenarios.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input/Output Variables: STR (target string), RUN (operation mode), OFFSET (buffer offset), KEY (key), VALUE (value), PT (network buffer).\n  - Output Variables: RESULT (parsing result).\n  - Internal Variables: step (parsing step), size (buffer size), c (current character), k_add (key character), v_add (value character), i (index), state (state), eof (buffer end flag), pv (value pointer), pk (key pointer), pve (value end address), pke (key end address), watchdog (watchdog timer).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - When RUN > 0, the function block starts. If the state is 0, initialization is performed:\n       - Initialize key and value pointers, and set the first character of key and value to 0 (empty string).\n       - Set index i to OFFSET and size to buffer size minus 1.\n       - Initialize RESULT to 0, set state to 5, and step to 0.\n     - Start the watchdog timer to monitor the parsing process.\n\n  -- REGION Parsing Loop\n     - When state is 5, enter the parsing loop:\n       - Call the watchdog timer; exit the loop if it times out.\n       - If index i exceeds the buffer size, set state to 10 and exit the loop.\n       - Otherwise, read the current character c and check if the buffer end (eof) is reached.\n       - Based on the step value, execute different parsing logic:\n         - step 0: Check if the character is '[', ';', or '#', or if it is a printable character, and jump to different steps accordingly.\n         - step 100: Skip comments or empty lines.\n         - step 200: Parse the key section until encountering ']' or the buffer end.\n         - step 300: Parse the key section until encountering '=' or the buffer end.\n         - step 330 and 350: Parse the value section until encountering a non-printable character or the buffer end.\n       - If a key or value character is parsed, store it at the respective pointer location and update the pointer.\n       - Update index i and continue parsing the next character.\n\n  -- REGION State Handling\n     - Based on the state value, execute different handling logic:\n       - state 1: Check the RUN mode; return result 1 if matched, otherwise return result 11.\n       - state 2: Check the RUN mode; return result 2 if matched.\n       - state 3: Update OFFSET and reset state to 0.\n       - state 5: Return result 5.\n       - state 10: Return result 10 and reset RUN and state.\n\n  -- REGION Conclusion\n     - After the function block execution, update output variables RESULT and OFFSET based on the parsing results and state, and reset RUN and state.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements INI format buffer parsing through a state machine and step control. It supports multiple operation modes, flexibly handles various parsing requirements, and ensures parsing reliability via a watchdog timer.", "name": "INI_PARSER_BUF"}

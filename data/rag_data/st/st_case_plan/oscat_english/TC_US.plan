{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `TC_US`, which is used to calculate time differences. It retrieves the current time (in microseconds) by calling the `T_PLC_US()` function and computes the difference between the current time and the last recorded time, then outputs this difference.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Output variable: `TC`, which stores the calculated time difference (in microseconds).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `init`: A boolean flag indicating whether the function block has been initialized.\n    - `tx`: A DWORD variable storing the current time.\n    - `last`: A DWORD variable storing the last recorded time.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. **Get Current Time**: The current time (in microseconds) is obtained by calling `T_PLC_US()` and assigned to `tx`.\n    2. **Initialization Check**: If `init` is `FALSE` (indicating the function block is uninitialized), set `init` to `TRUE` and initialize `TC` to `0`.\n    3. **Calculate Time Difference**: If the function block is already initialized, compute the difference between the current time `tx` and the last recorded time `last`, then assign the result to `TC`.\n    4. **Update Last Recorded Time**: Assign the current time `tx` to `last` for use in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this function block involves recording the current time and the previous time, calculating the difference between them, and outputting this difference. During initialization, the time difference is set to `0`. In subsequent calls, the function block updates and outputs the new time difference. This logic is suitable for applications requiring time interval measurements.", "name": "TC_US"}

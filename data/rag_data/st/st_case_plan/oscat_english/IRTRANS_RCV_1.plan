{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a simple function block `IRTRANS_RCV_1` designed to receive infrared signals and check whether the device code and key code match. If they match and the command signal is true, the output `Q` will be set to true.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `DEV_CODE` (device code), `KEY_CODE` (key code), `CMD` (command signal).\n  - Input/output variables: `DEV` (device code), `KEY` (key code).\n  - Output variable: `Q` (output signal).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     The logic of the function block is very straightforward, implemented in a single line of code:\n     ```\n     Q := cmd AND dev_code = dev AND key_code = key;\n     ```\n     This line of code means:\n     - If `CMD` is true, and `DEV_CODE` matches `DEV`, and `KEY_CODE` matches `KEY`, then output `Q` will be true.\n     - Otherwise, output `Q` will be false.\n     This logic is commonly used in infrared signal receivers to verify whether the received device code and key code match the expected values, and to trigger the output when the command signal is valid.", "name": "IRTRANS_RCV_1"}

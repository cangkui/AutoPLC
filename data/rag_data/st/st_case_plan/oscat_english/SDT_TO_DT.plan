{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `SDT_TO_DT`, which converts a time-date structure of type `SDT` into a standard time-date format of type `DT`. `SDT` is a structured date-time type, while `DT` is the standard date-time format in Siemens PLC. The conversion is achieved by calling the `SET_DT` function.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variable: `DTI`, of type `SDT`, containing information such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.\n - Output variable: `SDT_TO_DT`, of type `DT`, representing the converted standard date-time format.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Conversion Logic:\n   The core logic of the function involves using the `SET_DT` function to extract and convert the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the `SDT` structure into the `DT` format. The specific steps are as follows:\n   1. Extract the values of year (`YEAR`), month (`MONTH`), day (`DAY`), hour (`HOUR`), minute (`MINUTE`), and second (`SECOND`) from the input parameter `DTI`.\n   2. Pass these values as parameters to the `SET_DT` function to generate a date-time value of type `DT`.\n   3. Assign the return value of the `SET_DT` function to `SDT_TO_DT` as the function's output.\n\n   The purpose of this function is to convert structured date-time information into a standard date-time format for use in PLC programs.", "name": "SDT_TO_DT"}

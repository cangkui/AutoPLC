{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block, named `PRINT_SF`, is designed to handle string substitution operations. It achieves formatted string output by locating specific characters and replacing them with corresponding values.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input/Output Variables: `PRINTF_DATA` (of type `PRINTF_DATA`, used to store formatted data) and `STR` (of type `STRING`, with a length of `LOG_SIZE`, used to store the input string).\n - Internal Variables: `pos` (of type `INT`, used to store the position of the searched character), `c` (of type `INT`, used to store the ASCII value of a character), `src` (of type `STRING`, length 1, initialized to `'~'`, representing the character to search for), and `run` (of type `BOOL`, used to control loop execution).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION String Processing\n   First, it checks if the length of the input string `STR` is greater than 0. If so, it sets `run` to `TRUE`, indicating that string processing can begin.\n   Within the `WHILE` loop, the following operations are performed:\n   1. The `FIND` function is used to locate the position of the `src` character in `STR`, storing the result in `pos`.\n   2. `PRINTF_DATA[10]` is initialized as an empty string.\n   3. If `pos` is 0, it means the `src` character was not found, so `run` is set to `FALSE` to exit the loop.\n   4. If `pos` is not 0, the ASCII value of the character at position `pos + 1` in `STR` is retrieved and stored in `c`.\n   5. The `OSCAT_BASIC.ISC_NUM` function checks if `c` is a numeric character. If true, `c` is adjusted by subtracting 48 (the ASCII offset for numeric characters), and the value of `PRINTF_DATA[c]` is assigned to `PRINTF_DATA[10]`.\n   6. It checks if the combined length of `PRINTF_DATA[10]` and `STR` exceeds `LOG_SIZE`. If so, `PRINTF_DATA[10]` is truncated to `'..'`.\n   7. The value of `STR` is assigned to `PRINTF_DATA[11]`, then the `REPLACE` function is used to substitute 2 characters starting from `pos` in `STR` with `PRINTF_DATA[10]`, and the result is reassigned to `STR`.\n   The loop continues until no more `src` characters are found in `STR`.", "name": "PRINT_SF"}

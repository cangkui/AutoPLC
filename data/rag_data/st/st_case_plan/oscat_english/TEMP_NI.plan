{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block is named `TEMP_NI` and is used to calculate a temperature value based on the input resistance value `Res` and the reference resistance value `R0`. The output of this function block is a temperature value of type `REAL`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `Res`: The current resistance value of the device.\n    - `R0`: The reference resistance value of the device.\n  - Output Variables:\n    - `TEMP_NI`: The calculated temperature value, of type `REAL`.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Temperature Value\n    The core logic of this function block is a mathematical formula used to compute the temperature value based on the input resistance value `Res` and the reference resistance value `R0`. The formula is as follows:\n    ```\n    TEMP_NI := (SQRT(0.30085225 - 2.66E-3 * (R0 - Res)) - 0.5485) * 751.8796992;\n    ```\n    The steps of this formula are as follows:\n    1. Calculate `R0 - Res` to obtain the resistance difference.\n    2. Multiply the resistance difference by `2.66E-3`, then subtract this result from `0.30085225`.\n    3. Take the square root of the above result to obtain an intermediate value.\n    4. Subtract `0.5485` from the intermediate value, then multiply the result by `751.8796992` to obtain the final temperature value `TEMP_NI`.\n    This formula may be used for calibration or conversion of a certain temperature sensor, translating resistance values into corresponding temperature values.", "name": "TEMP_NI"}

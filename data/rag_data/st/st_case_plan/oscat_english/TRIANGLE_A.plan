{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `TRIANGLE_A` and is used to calculate the area of a triangle. Based on the input parameters, the function provides two calculation methods: one using the lengths of three sides (Heron's formula), and the other using the lengths of two sides and their included angle (sine formula).\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `S1`, `A`, `S2`, `S3`, representing the side lengths and angle of the triangle.\n  - Output variable: `TRIANGLE_A`, representing the calculated area of the triangle.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Triangle Area\n    The core logic of the function is a conditional check that selects the calculation method based on the value of input parameter `A`:\n    - If `A = 0.0`, Heron's formula is used to calculate the triangle area. Heron's formula is based on the lengths of the three sides, given by:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{(s1+s2+s3) \\cdot (s1+s2-s3) \\cdot (s2+s3-s1) \\cdot (s3+s1-s2)} \\cdot 0.25\n      \\]\n      where `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` are the lengths of the three sides.\n    - If `A â‰  0.0`, the sine formula is used to calculate the triangle area. The sine formula is based on the lengths of two sides and their included angle, given by:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Area} = s1 \\cdot s2 \\cdot \\sin(\\text{rad}(A)) \\cdot 0.5\n      \\]\n      where `s1` and `s2` are the lengths of the two sides, `A` is the included angle (in degrees), and `RAD(A)` converts the angle to radians.\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n    After the calculation, the function assigns the result to the output variable `TRIANGLE_A` and returns this value.", "name": "TRIANGLE_A"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `TRIM1` designed to remove excess spaces from an input string. Specifically, it deletes consecutive spaces within the string and trims any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `str`, representing the string to be processed.\n  - Internal variable: `pos`, used to store the position of found spaces.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    The primary logic of the function consists of the following steps:\n    1. **Initialization**: Assign the input string `str` to `TRIM1` as the target string for processing.\n    2. **Remove Consecutive Spaces**:\n       - Use a `REPEAT` loop to find instances of two consecutive spaces (`'  '`) in the string.\n       - If consecutive spaces are found (`pos > 0`), replace them with a single space using the `REPLACE` function.\n       - Continue the loop until no more consecutive spaces remain (`pos = 0`).\n    3. **Trim Leading and Trailing Spaces**:\n       - Use the `LEFT` function to check if the first character is a space. If so, delete it using the `DELETE` function.\n       - Use the `RIGHT` function to check if the last character is a space. If so, delete it using the `DELETE` function.\n    4. **Return Result**: The processed string `TRIM1` is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Summary\n  Through loops and conditional checks, this function systematically removes excess spaces from the string, ultimately returning a string with no consecutive spaces and no leading or trailing spaces. This approach is useful for cleaning user input or formatting strings in various scenarios.", "name": "TRIM1"}

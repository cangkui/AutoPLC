{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a functional block `TP_1D` designed to handle input signal delay and pulse generation. It includes a delay (PT1) and a pulse width (PTD), generating corresponding output signals when triggered by the input signal. The block also supports a reset function to clear internal states and outputs.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `PT1` (delay time), `PTD` (pulse width time), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (delayed output signal), `W` (pulse output signal).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `start` (start time), `ix` (input signal state from the previous cycle).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset\n     - First, the current time is obtained via `DWORD_TO_TIME(T_PLC_MS())` and assigned to `tx`.\n     - If the reset signal `RST` is true, outputs `Q` and `W` are reset to false, and `RST` is set to false to clear the reset state.\n  -- REGION Pulse Width Handling\n     - If `W` is true, it indicates the current phase is pulse width. The code checks whether the difference between the current time `tx` and the start time `start` is greater than or equal to the pulse width time `PTD`. If so, `W` is set to false to end the pulse output.\n  -- REGION Delay Handling\n     - If the input signal `IN` is true and the previous cycle's input signal `ix` is false (i.e., a rising edge is detected), the delay phase begins:\n       - Output `Q` is set to true.\n       - The current time `tx` is recorded as the start time `start`.\n       - The input signal `IN` is set to false to prevent repeated triggers.\n  -- REGION Delay End and Pulse Start\n     - If the difference between the current time `tx` and the start time `start` is greater than or equal to the delay time `PT1`, the delay phase ends:\n       - Output `Q` is set to false.\n       - Output `W` is set to true, initiating the pulse width phase.\n       - The start time `start` is updated to the current time `tx`.\n  -- REGION Input Signal State Update\n     - Finally, the current state of the input signal `IN` is saved to `ix` for edge detection in the next cycle.\n\n- Output Results\n  - `Q`: After the input signal triggers, it becomes true after a delay of `PT1` time, then remains false during the `PTD` period.\n  - `W`: After the delay ends, it becomes true and remains so for `PTD` time before reverting to false.", "name": "TP_1D"}

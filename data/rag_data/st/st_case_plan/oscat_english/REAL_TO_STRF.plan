  "planning": "- Overview\n  This is a function named `REAL_TO_STRF` designed to convert a real number (REAL type) into a formatted string (STRING type) based on specified precision and decimal separator. Its primary purpose is to transform floating-point numbers into human-readable string representations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables:\n    - `IN`: The real number to be converted (REAL type).\n    - `N`: The number of decimal places (INT type).\n    - `D`: The decimal separator (STRING[1] type).\n  - Internal Variables:\n    - `O`: Stores the converted real number (REAL type).\n    - `i`: Loop counter (INT type).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Input Validation & Initialization\n    - First, the decimal places `N` are constrained to a range of 0 to 7 (via `LIMIT(0, N, 7)`).\n    - The absolute value of the input real number `IN` is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `N` (via `ABS(IN) * EXP10(N)`), and the result is stored in variable `O`. This step converts the fractional part into an integer for easier processing.\n    - `O` is then converted to an integer (DINT type) using `REAL_TO_DINT`, and further transformed into a string via `DINT_TO_STRING`, which is stored in the function's return value `REAL_TO_STRF`.\n\n  -- REGION String Formatting\n    - A `FOR` loop is used to pad the string with leading zeros until its length matches `N`. For example, if `N = 3` and the string is \"12\", it becomes \"012\".\n    - If `N > 0`, the decimal separator `D` is inserted at the appropriate position. For instance, if `N = 2` and the string is \"0123\", the separator is inserted between \"01\" and \"23\", resulting in \"01.23\".\n    - If the input real number `IN` is negative, a minus sign `-` is prepended to the string. For example, if the intermediate result is \"01.23\", the final output becomes \"-01.23\".\n\n  -- REGION Output Result\n    - The function ultimately returns the formatted string `REAL_TO_STRF`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function systematically converts a real number into a string while ensuring the output adheres to the specified precision and decimal separator requirements. It is particularly useful for scenarios requiring formatted floating-point displays, such as in user interfaces or logging systems.",

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `V3_YANG`, which calculates the elevation angle (i.e., the angle in the Y-axis direction) of a 3D vector `A`. The function returns a `REAL` type value representing the elevation angle in radians.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `A` is a 3D vector representing the input vector.\n - Local variable: `la` is a `REAL` type variable used to store the length (magnitude) of the vector.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Calculate Vector Length\n    First, the `V3_ABS` function is called to compute the length (magnitude) of vector `A`, and the result is stored in the variable `la`.\n -- REGION Calculate Elevation Angle\n    If the vector length `la` is greater than 0.0, the `ACOS` function is used to calculate the elevation angle of vector `A` in the Y-axis direction. The specific formula is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{V3\\_YANG} = \\text{ACOS}\\left(\\frac{A.Y}{\\text{la}}\\right)\n    \\]\n    Here, `A.Y` is the Y-axis component of vector `A`, and `la` is the vector length. The `ACOS` function returns the arccosine value, which is the elevation angle in radians.\n -- REGION Return Result\n    If the vector length `la` is greater than 0.0, the calculated elevation angle is assigned to `V3_YANG` and returned. If `la` is not greater than 0.0, the function skips the `ACOS` calculation and terminates directly.\n\n- Notes\n - This function assumes the input vector `A` is a valid 3D vector.\n - If the vector length is 0, the function does not compute the elevation angle and terminates immediately.\n - The returned elevation angle is in radians.", "name": "V3_YANG"}

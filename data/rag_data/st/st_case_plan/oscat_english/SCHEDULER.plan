{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a functional block named 'SCHEDULER' designed to schedule output signals based on input signals and time intervals. It operates by polling each input signal in sequence, checking if the time condition is met, and setting the corresponding output signal when the condition is satisfied.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: E0, E1, E2, E3 (Boolean, representing input signals); T0, T1, T2, T3 (time-type, representing time intervals).\n  - Output variables: Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 (Boolean, representing output signals).\n  - Internal variables: init (Boolean, used for initialization); s0, s1, s2, s3 (time-type, storing the last trigger time); tx (time-type, storing the current time); c (integer, used for polling count).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n      First, the current time is retrieved using `DWORD_TO_TIME(T_PLC_MS())` and stored in the variable `tx`. If `init` is false (indicating the first run), initialization is performed: `s0`, `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` are set to the current time minus their respective time intervals, and `init` is set to true to mark completion of initialization.\n  -- REGION Output Initialization\n      The output signals `Q0`, `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` are initialized to false.\n  -- REGION Polling Scheduler\n      A `CASE` statement is used to poll and check each input signal based on the value of variable `c`:\n      - When `c` is 0, check if `E0` meets the time condition (i.e., whether the difference between the current time `tx` and the last trigger time `s0` is greater than or equal to `T0`). If met, set `Q0` to the value of `E0` and update `s0` to the current time. Then set `c` to 1 to proceed to the next poll.\n      - When `c` is 1, check if `E1` meets the time condition (i.e., whether the difference between `tx` and `s1` is ≥ `T1`). If met, set `Q1` to `E1` and update `s1` to the current time. Then set `c` to 2.\n      - When `c` is 2, check if `E2` meets the time condition (i.e., whether the difference between `tx` and `s2` is ≥ `T2`). If met, set `Q2` to `E2` and update `s2` to the current time. Then set `c` to 3.\n      - When `c` is 3, check if `E3` meets the time condition (i.e., whether the difference between `tx` and `s3` is ≥ `T3`). If met, set `Q3` to `E3` and update `s3` to the current time. Then reset `c` to 0 to restart polling.\n\n  In this way, the functional block sequentially checks each input signal and triggers the corresponding output signal when the time condition is met, implementing a simple scheduling mechanism.", "name": "SCHEDULER"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CASINH`, which calculates the inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) of a complex number. The inverse hyperbolic sine function is the inverse of the hyperbolic sine function, defined as `CASINH(z) = ln(z + sqrt(z^2 + 1))`. The function computes the result using the real and imaginary parts of the complex number and returns a complex value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, representing the input complex number, with a real part `X.re` and an imaginary part `X.im`.\n  - Internal variable: `Y`, representing an intermediate calculation result as a complex number, with a real part `Y.re` and an imaginary part `Y.im`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculating Intermediate Result `Y`\n    1. First, compute the real part of `Y`: `Y.re = (X.re - X.im) * (X.re + X.im) + 1.0`. This operation uses the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to derive `Y.re`.\n    2. Next, compute the imaginary part of `Y`: `Y.im = 2.0 * X.re * X.im`. This operation uses the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to derive `Y.im`.\n    3. Then, call the `CSQRT` function to compute the square root of `Y`, i.e., `Y = CSQRT(Y)`. This step updates `Y` to its square root result.\n\n  -- REGION: Calculating Final Result\n    1. Add the real part of `Y` to the real part of `X`: `Y.re = Y.re + X.re`.\n    2. Add the imaginary part of `Y` to the imaginary part of `X`: `Y.im = Y.im + X.im`.\n    3. Finally, call the `CLOG` function to compute the natural logarithm of `Y`, i.e., `CASINH = CLOG(Y)`. This step yields the final inverse hyperbolic sine value, which is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Output Result\n  The function returns `CASINH`, which is the inverse hyperbolic sine value of the input complex number `X`. This value is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts.", "name": "CASINH"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `FT_INT2` implements an integrator function for integrating input signals, supporting reset, output limiting, and runtime control. It is primarily used in continuous control systems to calculate the integral of an input signal while ensuring the output stays within specified bounds.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` is the input signal, `K` is the integration gain (default value 1.0), `RUN` is the runtime control signal (default value TRUE), `RST` is the reset signal, and `OUT_MIN` and `OUT_MAX` are the minimum and maximum output limits.\n  - Output variables: `OUT` is the integration result, and `LIM` is a flag indicating whether the output is limited.\n  - Internal variables: `integ` is the integrator instance, `ix` is an intermediate result of the integrator, and `val` is a `REAL2` type variable storing the integral value.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Integration Calculation and Reset Logic\n     - If the reset signal `RST` is TRUE, the integral value `val` and output `OUT` are reset to 0.\n     - If `RST` is FALSE, the integrator `integ` calculates the integral of the input signal `IN`, storing the result in `ix`. The value of `ix` is then added to `val`, and `ix` is reset to 0. Finally, the value of `val.RX` is assigned to the output `OUT`.\n  \n  -- REGION Output Limiting and Flag Setting\n     - If the output `OUT` is between `OUT_MIN` and `OUT_MAX`, the limit flag `LIM` is set to `FALSE`, indicating the output is not limited.\n     - If `OUT` exceeds `OUT_MIN` or `OUT_MAX`, the `LIMIT` function restricts the output to the range between `OUT_MIN` and `OUT_MAX`, and `val` is set to the limited value. The flag `LIM` is set to `TRUE`, indicating the output is limited.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block integrates input signals using an integrator while supporting reset, output limiting, and runtime control. It ensures the output remains within specified bounds and uses the `LIM` flag to indicate whether the output is limited. This block is suitable for control systems requiring integral calculations and output constraints.", "name": "FT_INT2"}

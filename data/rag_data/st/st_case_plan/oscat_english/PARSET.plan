{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block is named `PARSET` and is used to gradually adjust the output values `P1` to `P4` from their current values to target values based on changes in input signals. The transition time is controlled by the input `TC`, and the transition process can be triggered by input signals `A0` and `A1`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `A0` and `A1` are Boolean signals used to trigger the transition process; `X01` to `X34` are real values representing target values; `TC` is a time value used to control the transition duration.\n - Output variables: `P1` to `P4` are real values representing the current output values.\n - Internal variables: `X` is a two-dimensional array used to store target values; `S1` to `S4` are real values representing the transition slopes; `tx` and `last` are DWORD types used to record timestamps; `start` is a Boolean signal indicating whether the transition is in progress; `set` is a byte type used to store the index of the current target value; `init` is a Boolean signal indicating whether initialization is complete.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Initialization\n    During the first run of the function block, internal variables are initialized. The input values `X01` to `X34` are stored in the two-dimensional array `X`, and the outputs `P1` to `P4` are initialized to the values of `X01` to `X04`. Additionally, `set.0` is set based on the input `A0`, and the `init` flag is set to `TRUE` to indicate that initialization is complete.\n\n -- REGION Transition Trigger\n    If the input signals `A0` or `A1` change (detected via an `XOR` operation), the values of `set.0` and `set.1` are updated, and the transition process is initiated. If `TC` is greater than 0 seconds, the transition slopes `S1` to `S4` are calculated, the current timestamp `tx` is recorded in `last`, and the `start` flag is set to `TRUE` to indicate the transition has begun.\n\n -- REGION Transition Execution\n    If the transition is in progress (`start` is `TRUE`) and the difference between the current time and the transition start time is less than `TC`, the output values `P1` to `P4` are gradually adjusted based on the slopes `S1` to `S4` to smoothly transition to the target values.\n\n -- REGION Transition Completion\n    If the transition time has elapsed (the difference between the current time and the transition start time is greater than or equal to `TC`), the output values `P1` to `P4` are directly set to the target values, and the `start` flag is set to `FALSE` to indicate the transition is complete.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block detects changes in input signals to initiate a transition process and gradually adjusts the output values over the specified time `TC` to smoothly reach the target values. During the transition, the rate of change in the output values is controlled by the slopes `S1` to `S4`, ensuring smooth and controllable transitions.", "name": "PARSET"}

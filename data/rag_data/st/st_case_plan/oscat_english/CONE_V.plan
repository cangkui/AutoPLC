Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function named `CONE_V` to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the cone and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `rx` (radius of the cone) and `hx` (height of the cone).\n  - Output variable: `cone_V` (volume of the cone, the calculated result).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculate Cone Volume\n     This region contains the core logic of the function, which calculates the volume of the cone. The formula is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{cone\\_V} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times \\text{rx}^2 \\times \\text{hx}\n     \\]\n     Here, `1.047197551` is an approximate value of \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi\\). The function substitutes the input parameters `rx` and `hx` into the formula to compute the cone's volume and assigns the result to `cone_V`.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     After the function completes execution, it outputs the calculated `cone_V` as the return value.", "name": "CONE_V"}

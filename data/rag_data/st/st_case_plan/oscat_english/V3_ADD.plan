{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple SCL function named `V3_ADD`, designed to compute the addition of two three-dimensional vectors (`Vector_3`). The function returns a new three-dimensional vector where each component is the sum of the corresponding components of the two input vectors.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variables: `A` and `B`, of type `Vector_3`, representing the two three-dimensional vectors.\n - Output variable: The function return value `V3_ADD`, of type `Vector_3`, representing the sum of the two input vectors.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Vector Addition Calculation\n   This region implements the addition of three-dimensional vectors. The specific steps are as follows:\n   1. Calculate the X component: Add the X components of input vectors `A` and `B`, and assign the result to `V3_ADD.X`.\n   2. Calculate the Y component: Add the Y components of input vectors `A` and `B`, and assign the result to `V3_ADD.Y`.\n   3. Calculate the Z component: Add the Z components of input vectors `A` and `B`, and assign the result to `V3_ADD.Z`.\n   Finally, the function returns a new three-dimensional vector `V3_ADD`, where each component is the sum of the corresponding components of the two input vectors.", "name": "V3_ADD"}

Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a functional block named `FLOW_CONTROL`, designed to manage flow logic. It controls the state of the output signal `Q` through input signals and timers, while setting the status code `STATUS` based on different conditions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `REQ` (request signal), `ENQ` (enable signal), `RST` (reset signal), `T_AUTO` (auto timer duration), `T_DELAY` (delay timer duration).\n  - Output variables: `Q` (output signal), `STATUS` (status code).\n  - Internal variables: `timer` (timer instance, of type `TP_1D`).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Initialization and Reset\n     - First, initialize `STATUS` to `100`.\n     - If `RST` is true, perform a reset operation:\n       - Set output `Q` to `FALSE`.\n       - Reset the timer `timer` and set `timer.RST` to `FALSE`.\n       - Set `STATUS` to `103`, indicating a reset state.\n\n  -- REGION Enable Signal Handling\n     - If `ENQ` is true, further check other input signals:\n       - If `IN` is true, set `STATUS` to `101`, indicating the input signal is active.\n       - If `REQ` is true, configure the timer:\n         - Set `timer.PT1` to `T_AUTO` (auto timer duration).\n         - Set `timer.PTD` to `T_DELAY` (delay timer duration).\n         - Start the timer by setting `timer.IN` to `TRUE`.\n         - Set `STATUS` to `102`, indicating request signal processing.\n\n  -- REGION Timer Handling and Output Calculation\n     - Invoke the logic of timer `timer`.\n     - Set `timer.IN` to `FALSE` to stop the timer.\n     - Calculate the value of output `Q`:\n       - If both `IN` and `ENQ` are true, or if timer `timer.Q` is true, set `Q` to `TRUE`.\n       - Otherwise, `Q` remains `FALSE`.\n\n- Summary\nThe `FLOW_CONTROL` functional block controls the state of output signal `Q` through input signals and timers. It supports handling reset, enable, and request signals, and sets the status code `STATUS` based on different conditions. The timer is used to manage the duration of the output signal after a request signal is triggered, according to the configured time parameters.", "name": "FLOW_CONTROL"}

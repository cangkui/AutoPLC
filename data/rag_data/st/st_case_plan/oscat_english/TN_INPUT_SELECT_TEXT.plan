  "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a functional block named `TN_INPUT_SELECT_TEXT`, designed to handle the selection and display logic for text input. It achieves this by managing input focus, updating input content, and controlling screen display.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input-related variables: `in_count` stores the number of elements in the input data, `by_Attr` stores attribute values, and `st_String` stores the processed string.\n - Functional block instance: `FB_TN_SC_WRITE` is an instance used for screen writing.\n - Structure variables: `Xus_TN_SCREEN` and `Xus_TN_INPUT_CONTROL_DATA` are structures that store screen and input control data, respectively.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n -- REGION Input Focus Handling\n     If `Xus_TN_INPUT_CONTROL_DATA.bo_Focus` is true (indicating the input currently has focus), the input events are processed as follows:\n     - If the input is a space key (ASCII code 32), the value of `in_selected` is incremented, and `bo_Update_Input` is set to true, indicating the input needs updating.\n     - If the input is an enter key (extended code 13), `bo_Input_Entered` is set to true, indicating the input is complete.\n\n -- REGION Input Update Handling\n     If `bo_Update_Input` or `bo_Update_All` is true, the following logic is executed:\n     - If `bo_Update_All` is true, indicating all content needs updating:\n       - The display position of the title is calculated based on the values of `in_Title_X_Offset` and `in_Title_Y_Offset`, and the `FB_TN_SC_WRITE` functional block is called to write the title to the screen.\n     - The number of elements in the input data is calculated and stored in `in_count`.\n     - If `in_count` is greater than 0, the input data is processed as follows:\n       - Ensure the value of `in_selected` is within the valid range (between 1 and `in_count`).\n       - Retrieve the corresponding input element based on the value of `in_selected` and format it using the `OSCAT_BASIC.FIX` function.\n       - Store the formatted string in `st_String` and set the attribute value `by_Attr` based on the focus status.\n       - Call the `FB_TN_SC_WRITE` functional block to write the formatted string to the screen.\n     - Update the cursor position to the input position.\n     - Reset `bo_Update_All` and `bo_Update_Input` to false, indicating the update is complete.",

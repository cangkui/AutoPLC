{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a simple function named 'IS_IP4', designed to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address. An IPv4 address consists of four parts separated by dots (`.`), so a valid IPv4 address should contain exactly three dots.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines one type of variable:\n - Input variable: `str`, of type `STRING`, representing the string to be checked.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   The core logic of the function is very straightforward. It uses the `OSCAT_BASIC.COUNT_CHAR` function to count the number of `.` characters in the input string. If the count of `.` equals 3, the function returns `TRUE`, indicating the string is a valid IPv4 address; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n   The specific steps are as follows:\n   1. Call the `OSCAT_BASIC.COUNT_CHAR` function, passing the input string `str` and the character `.`.\n   2. Check if the count of `.` equals 3.\n   3. If it equals 3, set the function return value `IS_IP4` to `TRUE`; otherwise, set it to `FALSE`.\n\n   The logic of this function is based on the basic format of an IPv4 address. However, it's important to note that it only checks the count of `.` and does not validate whether each part is a valid number (0-255) or whether the string complies with other IPv4 rules. Therefore, this function can only serve as a preliminary and simple check and cannot fully replace more rigorous IPv4 validation logic.", "name": "IS_IP4"}

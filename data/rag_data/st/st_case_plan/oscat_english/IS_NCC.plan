Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `IS_NCC`, is used to determine whether a string `str` does not contain any substring of another string `cmp`. If `str` does not contain any substring of `cmp`, it returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `str` and `cmp`, representing the main string to be checked and the substring, respectively.\n - Internal variables: `L` stores the length of the main string, and `pos` is the index used for traversing the main string.\n\n- Main Logic\n -- REGION Main Logic:\n    1. First, calculate the length of the main string `str` and store it in the variable `L`.\n    2. Use a `FOR` loop to traverse the main string `str` from the 1st character to the `L`th character.\n    3. In each iteration, use the `MID` function to extract a substring from `str` starting from the 1st character up to the current index `pos`.\n    4. Use the `FIND` function to check if the extracted substring exists in `cmp`. If a matching substring is found (i.e., the `FIND` return value is greater than 0), the function immediately ends and returns `FALSE`.\n    5. If no matching substring is found after the loop completes, set `IS_NCC` to `TRUE`, indicating that `str` does not contain any substring of `cmp`.", "name": "IS_NCC"}

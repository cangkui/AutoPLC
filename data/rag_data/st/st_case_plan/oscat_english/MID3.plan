{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `MID3`, which finds the median value among three input real numbers `IN1`, `IN2`, and `IN3`. Through comparison and swapping, it ensures the returned value is the middle one of the three inputs.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN1`, `IN2`, `IN3`, all of type `REAL`, representing the three input real numbers.\n - Internal variables: No explicitly defined internal variables, but temporary swapping and comparisons are used to implement the logic.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Comparison and Swapping\n   1. **First Comparison and Swap**:\n      - If `IN1` is greater than `IN2`, the values of `IN1` and `IN2` are swapped. After swapping, `IN1` holds the smaller value, and `IN2` holds the larger one.\n      - This step ensures `IN1` and `IN2` are ordered, i.e., `IN1 <= IN2`.\n   2. **Second Comparison**:\n      - If `IN2` is greater than `IN3`, the value of `IN2` is updated to `IN3`. This ensures `IN2` does not exceed `IN3`.\n   3. **Determining the Median**:\n      - The `SEL` function (selection function) is used to check if `IN1` is greater than `IN2`.\n      - If `IN1 > IN2`, the median is `IN2`; otherwise, it is `IN1`.\n      - Finally, `MID3` is assigned the median value and returned as the function's output.\n-- END REGION\n   After executing the function logic, the value of `MID3` is returned.\n\n- Summary\nThis function employs simple comparison and swapping operations to reliably return the median value among three input real numbers. The logic is clear and efficient, making it suitable for scenarios requiring quick median determination.", "name": "MID3"}

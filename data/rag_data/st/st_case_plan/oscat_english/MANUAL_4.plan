{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis is a function block named `MANUAL_4`, designed to control the states of four outputs (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3). It supports both manual and automatic modes. In manual mode, users can directly control the outputs via input signals (M0, M1, M2, M3) or toggle the output states using a stop button (STP). In automatic mode, the outputs are directly controlled by input signals (I0, I1, I2, I3).\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: I0, I1, I2, I3 (input signals in automatic mode), MAN (manual mode switch), STP (stop button), M0, M1, M2, M3 (input signals in manual mode).\n - Output variables: Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 (output signals), STATUS (status information, indicating the current operation mode or specific state in manual mode).\n - Internal variables: edge (used to detect the rising edge of the STP signal), pos (used to record the output toggle position in manual mode), tog (indicates whether the output state is being toggled in manual mode).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Manual Mode\n    If `MAN` is true, the function block is in manual mode. First, check if `tog` is false. If false, assign the manual input signals (M0, M1, M2, M3) directly to the output signals (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3) and set `STATUS` to 101, indicating that outputs are directly controlled by the user in manual mode. Then, check if the `STP` signal is pressed (by detecting the rising edge). If `STP` is true and `edge` is false, begin toggling the output states. Based on the value of `pos`, set one of Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 to true while the others are set to false, and update `STATUS` accordingly (110, 111, 112, 113). Finally, increment the value of `pos` using the `INC` function, with a range of 0 to 3.\n\n-- REGION Automatic Mode\n    If `MAN` is false, the function block is in automatic mode. Here, the input signals (I0, I1, I2, I3) are directly assigned to the output signals (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3), and `STATUS` is set to 100, indicating that outputs are controlled by input signals in automatic mode. Additionally, reset `tog` to false and set `pos` to 0.\n\n-- REGION Edge Detection\n    At the end of the logic, assign the current value of `STP` to `edge` to detect the rising edge of the `STP` signal in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block switches between manual and automatic modes via the `MAN` signal. In manual mode, users can control outputs directly using `M0, M1, M2, M3` or cycle through output states with the `STP` button. In automatic mode, outputs are directly controlled by `I0, I1, I2, I3`. `STATUS` indicates the current operation mode or specific state in manual mode.", "name": "MANUAL_4"}

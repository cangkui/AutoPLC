{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `YEAR_OF_DATE`, is designed to extract the year from a given date. It takes a `DATE` type input and returns an `INT` type year value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines one category of variables:\n  - Input variable: `IDATE`, representing the input date.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n     The logic of this function block is very straightforward and consists of the following steps:\n     1. Convert the input `DATE` type to `DWORD` type using the `DATE_TO_DWORD` function.\n     2. Add 43200 to the converted `DWORD` value (this adjusts the time baseline to ensure accurate calculation).\n     3. Divide the result by 31557600 (this converts seconds to years, using the number of seconds in a year as the coefficient).\n     4. Add 1970 to the result (this accounts for the Unix timestamp's starting year).\n     5. Finally, convert the `DWORD` type result to `INT` type and return it as the output.\n\n  The core idea of this code is to convert the date into a Unix timestamp and then derive the corresponding year through calculation.", "name": "YEAR_OF_DATE"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis function, named `CSIN`, is used to calculate the sine of a complex number. The sine of a complex number is computed using its real and imaginary parts, employing hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `X`, of type `complex`, representing the input complex number.\n  - Output variables: `CSIN.re` and `CSIN.im`, representing the real and imaginary parts of the computed complex number, respectively.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Calculate the Sine of a Complex Number\n  The core logic of this function is to compute the sine of a complex number. The sine of a complex number can be calculated using the following formulas:\n  - Real part: `CSIN.re = cosH(X.im) * SIN(X.re)`\n  - Imaginary part: `CSIN.im = sinH(X.im) * COS(X.re)`\n\n  Where:\n  - `cosH(X.im)` is the hyperbolic cosine of the imaginary part `X.im`.\n  - `SIN(X.re)` is the sine of the real part `X.re`.\n  - `sinH(X.im)` is the hyperbolic sine of the imaginary part `X.im`.\n  - `COS(X.re)` is the cosine of the real part `X.re`.\n\n  Through these calculations, the function returns a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are the results of the above formulas, respectively.", "name": "CSIN"}

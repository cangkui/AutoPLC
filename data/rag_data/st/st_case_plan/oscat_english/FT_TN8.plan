{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a simple FIR filter function block named 'FT_TN8'. It performs filtering by sampling the input signal and computing the output signal. The function block also generates a trigger signal to indicate when the output has been updated.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: Input signal (`in`) and sampling period (`T`).\n - Output variables: Output signal (`out`) and trigger signal (`trig`).\n - Internal variables:\n   - `length`: Filter length, fixed at 8.\n   - `X`: An array of length 8 to store sampled values of the input signal.\n   - `cnt`: A counter to track the current sampling point being processed.\n   - `last`: Timestamp of the last sample.\n   - `tx`: Current timestamp.\n   - `init`: Initialization flag to indicate whether the function block has completed initialization.\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization\n   The function block first retrieves the current timestamp and stores it in `tx`, then initializes the trigger signal `trig` to `FALSE`. If the function block has not been initialized (`init = FALSE`), it stores the current input value `in` into the array `X` at the position indicated by `cnt`, sets `init` to `TRUE`, and records the current timestamp in `last`.\n\n-- REGION Sampling and Filtering\n   If the function block is already initialized, it checks whether the difference between the current timestamp `tx` and the last sample timestamp `last` is greater than or equal to the sampling period `T` divided by the filter length `length` (i.e., the time interval for each sampling point). If the condition is met, the following actions are performed:\n   - Update the counter `cnt`: If `cnt` has reached the last position of the array (`length - 1`), it is reset to 0; otherwise, it is incremented.\n   - Assign the value of the current sampling point (`X[cnt]`) to the output signal `out`.\n   - Store the current input value `in` into the array `X` at the current position.\n   - Update the last sample timestamp `last` to the current timestamp `tx`.\n   - Set the trigger signal `trig` to `TRUE` to indicate that the output has been updated.\n\n- Output Results\nThe output signal `out` of the function block is the filtered signal value, while the trigger signal `trig` indicates whether the output signal has been updated. The trigger signal is set to `TRUE` after each sampling and filtering operation, allowing external systems to capture update events.\n\n- Summary\nThis function block implements a simple FIR filter by periodically sampling the input signal and computing the output signal. It uses a fixed-length array to store sampled values and manages sampling point updates via a counter. The trigger signal `trig` notifies external systems of changes in the output signal.", "name": "FT_TN8"}

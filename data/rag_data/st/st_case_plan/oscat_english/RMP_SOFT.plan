{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a soft ramp function block (RMP_SOFT), designed to gradually adjust the output value over a set time slope when the input value changes. The function block ensures a smooth transition of the output value to the target value by controlling its increase or decrease.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: IN (enable signal), VAL (target value), PT_ON (rise time), PT_OFF (fall time)\n - Output variable: OUT (current output value)\n - Internal variables: rmp (ramp function block instance), tmp (temporary storage value)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   1. **Temporary Value Calculation**:\n      - The `SEL` function is used to select either `0` or `VAL` as the temporary value `tmp` based on the input `IN`. If `IN` is true, `tmp` is set to `VAL`; otherwise, it is set to `0`.\n   \n   2. **Output Value Adjustment**:\n      - **If `tmp` is greater than the current output `OUT`**:\n        - The ramp function block `rmp` is called with the direction set to rise (`dir := TRUE`), the enable signal set to true (`E := TRUE`), the rise time set to `PT_ON`, and the output value `OUT` is updated.\n        - The `MIN` function ensures that the output `OUT` does not exceed `tmp`, achieving a smooth rise.\n      - **If `tmp` is less than the current output `OUT`**:\n        - The ramp function block `rmp` is called with the direction set to fall (`dir := FALSE`), the enable signal set to true (`E := TRUE`), the fall time set to `PT_OFF`, and the output value `OUT` is updated.\n        - The `MAX` function ensures that the output `OUT` does not fall below `tmp`, achieving a smooth decline.\n      - **If `tmp` equals the current output `OUT`**:\n        - The ramp function block `rmp` is disabled (`E := FALSE`), and the output `OUT` remains unchanged.\n\n- Role of the Ramp Function Block\n   - The ramp function block `rmp` controls the smooth change of the output value. By setting the rise time (`PT_ON`) and fall time (`PT_OFF`), it ensures the output value gradually approaches the target value at the defined slope.\n   - The direction parameter `dir` determines whether the output value increases or decreases.\n   - The enable signal `E` controls whether the ramp function block is active.\n\n- Output Result\n   - The output value `OUT` smoothly transitions to the target value based on changes in the input `VAL`, using the defined rise or fall times. If the input `IN` is false, the output value gradually decreases to `0`.", "name": "RMP_SOFT"}

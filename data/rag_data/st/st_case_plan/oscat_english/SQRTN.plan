{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `SQRTN`, which calculates the Nth root of a real number. The function takes two input parameters: a real number `X` and an integer `N`, and returns the computed result. If `N` is greater than 0, it calculates the Nth root of `X`; otherwise, it returns 0.0.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` (a real number representing the value to be computed) and `N` (an integer representing the root degree).\n  - Output variable: `SQRTN` (a real number representing the computed result).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Computation Logic\n    The core logic of the function is a simple conditional check:\n    - If `N` is greater than 0, it uses the mathematical formula `EXP(LN(X) / INT_TO_REAL(N))` to compute the Nth root of `X`. Here, `LN(X)` calculates the natural logarithm of `X`, `INT_TO_REAL(N)` converts the integer `N` to a real number, and then the `EXP` function computes the exponent to obtain the final Nth root.\n    - If `N` is less than or equal to 0, it directly returns `0.0`, as negative or zeroth roots are mathematically meaningless or undefined.\n    Finally, the computed result is assigned to the output variable `SQRTN` and returned.", "name": "SQRTN"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a function block named `TN_SC_READ_ATTR`, which is used to read the attribute value (e.g., color) from a specified position in the screen buffer. The function block calculates the offset based on the input coordinates (X, Y) and retrieves the corresponding attribute value from the screen buffer's attribute array.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `Iin_X` and `Iin_Y`, representing the coordinates on the screen.\n  - Output variable: `Oby_ATTR`, representing the attribute value read from the screen buffer.\n  - Local variable: `in_Offset`, used to calculate the offset within the screen buffer.\n  - Input-output variable: `Xus_TN_SCREEN`, representing the screen buffer structure, which includes the attribute array `bya_COLOR`.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Input Validation\n      First, the `TN_SC_XY_ERROR` function is called to verify whether the input coordinates (X, Y) are valid. If the coordinates are invalid, the function block returns immediately without executing subsequent logic.\n  -- REGION Offset Calculation\n      The offset in the screen buffer is calculated using the formula `in_Offset := (Iin_Y * 80) + Iin_X`. This assumes a screen width of 80 characters, so the Y coordinate is multiplied by 80 and then added to the X coordinate to obtain the index in the one-dimensional array.\n  -- REGION Attribute Reading\n      The attribute value corresponding to the offset `in_Offset` is read from the screen buffer's attribute array `Xus_TN_SCREEN.bya_COLOR` and assigned to the output variable `Oby_ATTR`.\n  -- REGION End\n      Once the function block completes execution, it terminates directly.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this function block involves calculating the offset in the screen buffer based on the input coordinates (X, Y) and reading the corresponding attribute value from the attribute array. If the coordinates are invalid, the function returns immediately to prevent erroneous operations. The code is concise and efficient, making it suitable for scenarios where attribute values need to be read from specific positions in the screen buffer.", "name": "TN_SC_READ_ATTR"}

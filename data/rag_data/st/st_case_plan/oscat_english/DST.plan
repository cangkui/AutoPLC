{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function named `DST` is used to determine whether a given UTC time falls within the Daylight Saving Time (DST) period. It calculates specific date and time ranges to identify if DST is active.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `UTC`, representing the input UTC time, of type `DT` (datetime).\n  - Internal variables:\n    - `yr`: Represents the year extracted from the UTC time, of type `INT`.\n    - `yr4`: Stores a calculated value related to the year, of type `DWORD`.\n    - `ltc`: Converts the UTC time to `DWORD` type for subsequent calculations.\n    - `idate`: Represents a specific date (March 31st, 1:00:00) as a `DWORD` value, used to compute the start and end of DST.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION: Calculate Year and Date\n    First, the year is extracted from the input UTC time and stored in the `yr` variable. The UTC time is then converted to `DWORD` type and stored in `ltc`. Next, the `DWORD` value for the specific date (March 31st, 1:00:00) is calculated and stored in `idate`.\n  \n  -- REGION: Compute Year-Related Value\n    The value of `yr4` is calculated using the formula `SHR(5 * INT_TO_DWORD(yr), 2) + 1`. This formula computes an offset related to DST based on the year.\n\n  -- REGION: Determine DST Status\n    The following logic determines whether DST is active:\n    - Calculate the DST start time: `idate - ((yr4 + 3) MOD 7) * 86400`. Here, `86400` is the number of seconds in a day, converting days to seconds.\n    - Calculate the DST end time: `idate + (214 - (yr4) MOD 7) * 86400`.\n    - Check if the current time `ltc` falls between the DST start and end times. If yes, `DST` returns `TRUE`, indicating DST is active; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.\n\n  Finally, the function returns the value of `DST`, indicating whether the given UTC time is within the DST period.", "name": "DST"}

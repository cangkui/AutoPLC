{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `SRAMP` implements a ramp function generator to produce smooth ramp outputs. Based on the input signal `X`, rise and fall accelerations `A_UP` and `A_DN`, maximum rise and fall speeds `VU_MAX` and `VD_MAX`, as well as upper and lower limits `LIMIT_HIGH` and `LIMIT_LOW`, it calculates the output `Y` and velocity `V`. The function block also supports a reset feature, allowing the output and velocity to be reset to initial values upon reset.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` (target value), `A_UP` (rise acceleration), `A_DN` (fall acceleration), `VU_MAX` (maximum rise speed), `VD_MAX` (maximum fall speed), `LIMIT_HIGH` (upper limit), `LIMIT_LOW` (lower limit), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `Y` (current output value), `V` (current velocity).\n  - Internal variables: `cycle_time` (cycle time), `init` (initialization flag).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     First, the `cycle_time` function is called to retrieve the current cycle time. Then, input parameters are processed as follows:\n     - `A_UP` and `VU_MAX` are constrained to non-negative values.\n     - `A_DN` and `VD_MAX` are constrained to non-positive values.\n     If the reset signal `RST` is true or the function block has not been initialized, the output `Y` and velocity `V` are reset to 0, and the initialization flag `init` is set to true.\n\n  -- REGION Target Value Equals Current Value\n     If the target value `X` equals the current output value `Y`, the velocity `V` is set to 0, indicating no further adjustment is needed.\n\n  -- REGION Target Value Greater Than Current Value\n     If the target value `X` is greater than the current output value `Y`, the new velocity `V` is calculated as follows:\n     - First, update the velocity `V` based on the rise acceleration `A_UP` and cycle time `cycle_time`, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum rise speed `VU_MAX`.\n     - Then, adjust the velocity `V` based on the difference between the current output value `Y` and the target value `X`, as well as the fall acceleration `A_DN`, ensuring it does not exceed the calculated value.\n     - Finally, update the output value `Y` based on the velocity `V` and cycle time `cycle_time`, ensuring it does not exceed the upper limit `LIMIT_HIGH`.\n\n  -- REGION Target Value Less Than Current Value\n     If the target value `X` is less than the current output value `Y`, the new velocity `V` is calculated as follows:\n     - First, update the velocity `V` based on the fall acceleration `A_DN` and cycle time `cycle_time`, ensuring it does not fall below the maximum fall speed `VD_MAX`.\n     - Then, adjust the velocity `V` based on the difference between the current output value `Y` and the target value `X`, as well as the rise acceleration `A_UP`, ensuring it does not fall below the calculated value.\n     - Finally, update the output value `Y` based on the velocity `V` and cycle time `cycle_time`, ensuring it does not fall below the lower limit `LIMIT_LOW`.\n\n- Output Results\n   Ultimately, the function block outputs the current value `Y` and velocity `V`, ensuring the output stays within the specified upper and lower limits and the velocity complies with acceleration and maximum speed constraints.", "name": "SRAMP"}

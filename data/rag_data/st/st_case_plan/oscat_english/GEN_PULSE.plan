Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code is a function block written in ST (Structured Text) named 'GEN_PULSE', designed to generate a pulse signal. The high-level duration (PTH) and low-level duration (PTL) of the pulse can be configured via input parameters. The function block uses an internal timer to toggle the state of the output signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: ENQ (enable signal), PTH (high-level duration), PTL (low-level duration)\n - Output variables: Q (pulse output signal)\n - Internal variables: tx (current time), tn (last toggle time), init (initialization flag)\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   This region contains the core logic of the function block for generating the pulse signal. First, it checks if the enable signal (ENQ) is true. If true, it retrieves the current time (tx) and checks if initialization is needed. If not initialized, it sets the initialization flag (init) to true and sets the last toggle time (tn) to the current time. Then, it checks if the difference between the current time and the last toggle time is greater than or equal to the pulse duration corresponding to the current output state (high-level or low-level duration). If the condition is met, it updates the last toggle time (tn) to the current time plus the corresponding pulse duration and toggles the state of the output signal (Q). If the enable signal (ENQ) is false, it resets the output signal (Q) to false and clears the initialization flag (init).", "name": "GEN_PULSE"}

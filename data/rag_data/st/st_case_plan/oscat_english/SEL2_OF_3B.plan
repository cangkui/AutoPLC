{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function block, named `SEL2_OF_3B`, implements a 'two-out-of-three' logic, where an output signal is generated when at least two out of three input signals are true. It also includes a delay feature to detect and output a delayed signal when input signals are inconsistent.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN1`, `IN2`, `IN3` represent three Boolean input signals, and `TD` represents the delay time.\n  - Output variables: `Q` represents the output of the 'two-out-of-three' logic, and `W` represents the delayed output.\n  - Internal variables: `TDEL` is an instance of `TON` (Timer On-Delay), used to implement the delay functionality.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n     - 'Two-out-of-three' logic: The output `Q` is determined by the Boolean expression `(IN1 AND IN2) OR (IN1 AND IN3) OR (IN2 AND IN3)`. This expression means `Q` is true when any two input signals are true.\n     - Delay logic: The input for the `TDEL` timer is determined by the Boolean expression `(IN1 XOR IN2) OR (IN1 XOR IN3) OR (IN2 XOR IN3)`. This expression means the timer starts when any two input signals are inconsistent. The preset time for `TDEL` is `TD`. When the timer reaches the preset time, `TDEL.Q` becomes true, and `W` outputs true.\n  -- REGION Output\n     - `Q` directly outputs the result of the 'two-out-of-three' logic.\n     - `W` outputs the result of the delay logic, i.e., `TDEL.Q`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function block implements the 'two-out-of-three' functionality through simple Boolean logic and uses a timer to output a delayed signal when input signals are inconsistent. Such logic is commonly used in scenarios requiring redundancy or consistency checks, such as safety systems or redundant control systems.", "name": "SEL2_OF_3B"}

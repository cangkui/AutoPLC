{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code implements a function named `EASTER` to calculate the date of Easter for a given year. The Easter date calculation is based on Gauss's algorithm, which determines the specific date of Easter in the Gregorian calendar through a series of mathematical operations.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variable: `year`, representing the year for which the Easter date needs to be calculated.\n  - Local variables:\n    - `b`: Stores intermediate calculation results related to the year and modulo operations.\n    - `c`: Stores intermediate calculation results related to the year, bit-shifting operations, and modulo operations.\n    - `oday`: Stores the day offset of Easter in March or April.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Calculating Easter Date\n    1. Calculate variable `b`:\n       - Compute the initial value of `b` using the formula `(204 - 11 * (year MOD 19)) MOD 30`.\n       - If `b` is greater than 27, subtract 1 from `b`. This step adjusts for special cases.\n    2. Calculate variable `c`:\n       - Compute the value of `c` using the formula `(year + SHR(year, 2) + b - 13) MOD 7`. `SHR(year, 2)` means shifting `year` right by two bits, equivalent to `year / 4`.\n    3. Calculate variable `oday`:\n       - Compute the value of `oday` using the formula `28 + b - c`. `oday` represents the day offset of Easter in March or April.\n    4. Determine the Easter date:\n       - If `oday` is greater than 33, the Easter date is April (`oday - 31`).\n       - Otherwise, the Easter date is March (`oday`).\n    5. Return the result:\n       - Use the `SET_DATE` function to encapsulate the calculated date as a `DATE` type and return it as the function's output.\n\n- Output\nThe function returns a `DATE` type value representing the Easter date for the given year. This date is calculated using Gauss's algorithm, taking into account the rules and special cases of the Gregorian calendar.", "name": "EASTER"}

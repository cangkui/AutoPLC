{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function named `TRIM`, which removes all whitespace characters from an input string. The function achieves this by locating and replacing whitespace characters.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n - Input variable: `str`, representing the string to be processed.\n - Internal variable: `pos`, used to store the position of whitespace characters within the string.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Main Logic\n   1. Initialization: Assign the input string `str` to `TRIM` as the base for processing.\n   2. Loop Processing:\n      - Use the `FIND` function to locate the position of the first whitespace character in the string `TRIM` and store the result in `pos`.\n      - If `pos` is greater than 0, indicating a whitespace character was found, use the `REPLACE` function to replace the whitespace character with an empty string (effectively deleting the whitespace).\n      - Repeat the above steps until the `FIND` function returns 0, indicating no more whitespace characters are present in the string.\n   3. Return Result: The processed string `TRIM` is returned as the function's output.\n\n- Output Result\nThe function ultimately returns a string with all whitespace characters removed.", "name": "TRIM"}

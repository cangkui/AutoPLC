{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function block `SW_RECONFIG` implements a time-based switching logic that toggles the output `Q` after the input signal `IN` remains active for a specified duration. It also supports an optional reconfiguration time `TR` to reconfigure the output after the state transition.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `IN` (input signal), `TD` (delay time), `TR` (reconfiguration time).\n  - Output variable: `Q` (output signal).\n  - Internal variables: `T1` (timer for delay), `T2` (timer for reconfiguration), `INV` (flag for inverting the output state).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Delay Logic\n     First, timer `T1` is used to detect whether the input signal `IN` remains active for the specified delay time `TD`. The input of `T1` is `IN`, and the timing is defined by `TD`. If `IN` is true and persists for `TD` duration, `T1.Q` becomes true.\n  \n  -- REGION Reconfiguration Logic\n     If the reconfiguration time `TR` is greater than zero, the reconfiguration logic is activated. Here, the output `Q` is determined by the XOR result of `T1.Q` and `INV`. This means `Q` will be true if either `T1.Q` is true and `INV` is false, or `T1.Q` is false and `INV` is true.\n     Next, timer `T2` is used to detect whether the output `Q` remains active for the specified reconfiguration time `TR`. The input of `T2` is `Q`, and the timing is defined by `TR`. If `Q` is true and persists for `TR` duration, `T2.Q` becomes true, inverting the state of `INV` (i.e., `INV := NOT INV`).\n  \n  -- REGION No Reconfiguration Logic\n     If the reconfiguration time `TR` is zero, the output `Q` directly takes the value of `T1.Q` without any reconfiguration.\n\n- Summary\n  The core logic of this function block uses timers `T1` and `T2` to control the state transition of output `Q`. `TD` determines the delay before the output state toggles, while `TR` determines whether reconfiguration is needed after the state transition. The `INV` flag enables periodic toggling of the output state.", "name": "SW_RECONFIG"}

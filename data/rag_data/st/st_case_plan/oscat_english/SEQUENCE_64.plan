Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `SEQUENCE_64`, designed to implement time-based sequence control. The block can trigger state transitions at specified time intervals based on the input time array `PROG`, while outputting the current state and a trigger signal.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `START` (start signal), `SMAX` (maximum state value), `PROG` (time array defining intervals for each state), `RST` (reset signal).\n  - Output variables: `STATE` (current state, initial value -1), `TRIG` (trigger signal indicating state transition).\n  - Internal variables: `tx` (current time), `edge` (used to detect rising edge of `START` signal), `last` (time of last state transition).\n\n- Main Logic\n-- REGION Initialization and Reset\n   - First, convert the current time `tx` to `TIME` type.\n   - Initialize the `TRIG` signal to `FALSE`, indicating no state transition has been triggered.\n   - If the `RST` signal is `TRUE`, reset `STATE` to -1, indicating the sequence is inactive.\n\n-- REGION Starting the Sequence\n   - If `START` is `TRUE` and a rising edge is detected (i.e., `edge` is `FALSE`), set `STATE` to 0 to start the sequence. Record the current time `last` and set `TRIG` to `TRUE` to signal a state transition.\n\n-- REGION State Transition\n   - If `STATE` is ≥ 0 (sequence active), check if the time difference between `tx` and `last` is ≥ the interval defined in `PROG[STATE]`.\n   - If true, call the `INC2` function to increment `STATE` by 1, clamping it between 0 and `SMAX`. Update `last` to the current time and set `TRIG` to `TRUE` to signal a state transition.\n\n-- REGION Detecting Rising Edge of `START` Signal\n   - Update the `edge` variable to the current value of `START` for detecting the rising edge in the next cycle.\n\n- Summary\nThe function block starts the sequence upon detecting a rising edge of `START` and transitions states based on intervals in `PROG`. Each transition outputs a `TRIG` signal indicating the state update. The `RST` signal resets the sequence by setting `STATE` to -1. This enables time-based multi-state control logic."}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview  \nThe function `D_TRUNC` is used to truncate a real number `X` to the nearest integer (rounding down). The function returns an integer value of type `DINT`. It handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the truncated integer does not exceed the original real value.  \n\n- Variable Definitions  \nThe following variables are defined in the code:  \n - Input variable: `X`, of type `REAL`, representing the real number to be truncated.  \n - Output variable: `D_TRUNC`, of type `DINT`, representing the truncated integer value.  \n\n- Main Logic  \n -- REGION Main Logic:  \n   1. First, convert the input real number `X` to an integer of type `DINT` and assign the result to `D_TRUNC`.  \n   2. If `X` is positive:  \n      - Check if the converted integer is greater than the original real value. If so, decrement `D_TRUNC` by 1 to ensure the truncated integer does not exceed the original real value.  \n   3. If `X` is negative:  \n      - Check if the converted integer is less than the original real value. If so, increment `D_TRUNC` by 1 to ensure the truncated integer does not exceed the original real value.  \n   4. Finally, the function returns the truncated integer value `D_TRUNC`.  \n\n- Output Result  \nThe function returns an integer value of type `DINT`, which is the result of rounding down the input real number `X`. Whether `X` is positive or negative, the function ensures that the truncated integer does not exceed the original real value.  ", "name": "D_TRUNC"}

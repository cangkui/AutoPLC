{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code defines a simple functional block `DEC_2`, which generates two output signals `Q0` and `Q1` based on the input signals `D` and `A`. This block can be understood as a basic decoder that determines whether the `D` signal is routed to `Q0` or `Q1` based on the value of `A`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `D` and `A`, representing the data signal and control signal, respectively.\n  - Output variables: `Q0` and `Q1`, representing the two outputs generated from the input signals.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Main Logic:\n    The logic of the functional block is very straightforward, computing the output values directly through Boolean expressions:\n    - `Q0` is the logical AND of `D` and `NOT A`. This means `Q0` is true when `D` is true and `A` is false.\n    - `Q1` is the logical AND of `D` and `A`. This means `Q1` is true when `D` is true and `A` is true.\n\n  The behavior of this functional block can be summarized as follows:\n  - If `D` is false, both `Q0` and `Q1` will be false regardless of the value of `A`.\n  - If `D` is true:\n    - When `A` is false, `Q0` is true and `Q1` is false.\n    - When `A` is true, `Q0` is false and `Q1` is true.\n\n  This type of logic is commonly used in simple signal routing or selection scenarios.", "name": "DEC_2"}

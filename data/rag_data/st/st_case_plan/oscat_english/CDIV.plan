Natural Language Requirements: {"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function `CDIV` is used to perform division between two complex numbers. Complex division requires multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, followed by normalization.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X` and `Y`, representing the dividend and divisor complex numbers, respectively.\n  - Internal variable: `Temp`, used to store the squared modulus of the denominator.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Compute the squared modulus of the denominator\n     First, calculate the squared modulus of the denominator, i.e., `Y.re * Y.re + Y.im * Y.im`, and store the result in the `Temp` variable. This value is used for subsequent normalization.\n\n  -- REGION Compute the real part of the complex number\n     Calculate the real part of the complex division using the formula `(X.re * Y.re + X.im * Y.im) / Temp`. This formula is derived by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The result is stored in `CDIV.re`.\n\n  -- REGION Compute the imaginary part of the complex number\n     Calculate the imaginary part of the complex division using the formula `(X.im * Y.re - X.re * Y.im) / Temp`. Similarly, this formula is derived by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The result is stored in `CDIV.im`.\n\n  -- REGION Return the result\n     Finally, the function returns `CDIV`, the result of the complex division, which includes both the real and imaginary parts.", "name": "CDIV"}

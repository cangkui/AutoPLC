{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThe function block `BCDC_TO_INT` is used to convert a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) number into an integer (INT). BCD is an encoding method where each decimal digit is represented by 4 binary bits. This function block extracts the units and tens digits from the BCD code and converts them into an integer.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines two types of variables:\n   - Input variable: `IN`, of type `BYTE`, representing the input BCD code.\n   - Output variable: `BCDC_TO_INT`, of type `INT`, representing the converted integer value.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  - REGION Conversion Logic\nThe logic of this function block is very straightforward and consists of the following steps:\n    1. Extract the units digit of the BCD code: Using `IN AND 16#0F`, the lower 4 bits of `IN` (i.e., the units digit) are retained.\n    2. Extract the tens digit of the BCD code: Using `SHR(IN, 4)`, `IN` is right-shifted by 4 bits to obtain the higher 4 bits (i.e., the tens digit), which is then multiplied by 10.\n    3. Add the units and tens digits: The extracted units and tens digits are summed to produce the final integer value.\n    4. Assign the result to `BCDC_TO_INT` as the output of the function block.\n\n    For example, if the input is `IN = 16#45` (i.e., the BCD code representing the decimal number 45):\n    - Units digit: `16#45 AND 16#0F = 5`\n    - Tens digit: `SHR(16#45, 4) = 4`, then `4 * 10 = 40`\n    - Final result: `5 + 40 = 45`, so `BCDC_TO_INT = 45`.\n\n    This function block is suitable for converting BCD codes into integers and is commonly used for processing BCD data read from certain devices or protocols.", "name": "BCDC_TO_INT"}

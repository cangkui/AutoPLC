{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This function, named `REFLECT`, is designed to perform a bit-reversal operation on an input data of type `DWORD`. Bit reversal refers to mirroring the binary representation of the data, such as converting `1101` to `1011`.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `D` (the `DWORD` data to be reversed) and `L` (the number of bits to reverse).\n  - Internal variable: `i` (an `INT` type variable used for loop counting).\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Initialization\n     - Initialize the output variable `REFLECT` to `0` to store the reversed result.\n  -- REGION Bit-Reversal Logic\n     - Use a `FOR` loop from `1` to `L` to reverse the bits one by one:\n       - Left-shift `REFLECT` by one bit (`SHL`) to make space for the new bit.\n       - Convert the least significant bit of `D` (`D.0`) to `DWORD` type using `BOOL_TO_DWORD`, then perform a bitwise OR operation (`OR`) with `REFLECT` to add the current bit to the result.\n       - Right-shift `D` by one bit (`SHR`) to process the next bit.\n     - After the loop, left-shift the remaining unprocessed bits (`D`) by `L` bits and perform a bitwise OR operation with `REFLECT` to ensure all bits are correctly reversed.\n  -- REGION Return Result\n     - Return the reversed result `REFLECT`.\n\n- Example\n  Suppose the input is `D = 13` (binary `1101`) and `L = 4`. The function execution proceeds as follows:\n  1. Initialize `REFLECT = 0`.\n  2. Loop 4 times:\n     - First iteration: `REFLECT = 1`, `D = 6` (`110`).\n     - Second iteration: `REFLECT = 10`, `D = 3` (`11`).\n     - Third iteration: `REFLECT = 101`, `D = 1` (`1`).\n     - Fourth iteration: `REFLECT = 1011`, `D = 0`.\n  3. The final result is `REFLECT = 11` (binary `1011`), which is the reversed form of `13`.\n\n- Summary\n  This function achieves bit reversal for `DWORD` type data through bit-by-bit operations, making it suitable for scenarios requiring binary data mirroring.", "name": "REFLECT"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  This code implements a function named `CAUCHY`, which calculates the probability density function value of the Cauchy distribution. The Cauchy distribution is a continuous probability distribution often used to describe data with heavy-tailed characteristics. The function takes three input parameters—`X`, `T`, and `U`—and returns a real value.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `X`, `T`, and `U`, representing the independent variable, location parameter, and scale parameter of the Cauchy distribution, respectively.\n  - Internal variable: `tmp`, used to store intermediate calculation results.\n\n- Main Logic\n  -- REGION Main Logic\n    1. **Intermediate Calculation**: First, compute `tmp = X - T`, which is the numerator part of the Cauchy distribution formula.\n    2. **Cauchy Distribution Calculation**: Use the formula `CAUCHY = (1 / π) * U / (U² + tmp²)` to calculate the probability density value of the Cauchy distribution. Here:\n       - `math.PI_INV` represents the reciprocal of π (i.e., 1/π).\n       - `U` is the scale parameter, controlling the width of the distribution.\n       - `tmp` is the difference between the independent variable `X` and the location parameter `T`.\n    3. **Return Value**: Assign the calculation result to the function name `CAUCHY`, which serves as the function's return value.\n\n  The logic of this function is very straightforward, directly implementing the probability density function formula of the Cauchy distribution. By providing the input parameters `X`, `T`, and `U`, the corresponding probability density value can be quickly computed.", "name": "CAUCHY"}

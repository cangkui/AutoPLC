{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis functional block, named `MESSAGE_8`, is designed to select and output a corresponding string based on the input boolean values. It checks the input boolean variables (`IN1` to `IN8`) to determine which string (`S1` to `S8`) should be assigned to the output variable `M`. If none of the inputs are true, the output will be an empty string.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n  - Input Variables: `IN1` to `IN8` are boolean inputs used to select the corresponding string; `S1` to `S8` are string inputs representing the optional string content.\n  - Output Variable: `M` is a string output representing the final selected string.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Selection Logic\n    This region implements the string selection logic. The code uses a series of `IF-ELSIF` statements to sequentially check the values of the input boolean variables `IN1` to `IN8`. If any boolean variable is true, the corresponding string is assigned to the output variable `M`. For example:\n    - If `IN1` is true, `M` is assigned the value of `S1`.\n    - If `IN2` is true, `M` is assigned the value of `S2`.\n    - This pattern continues up to `IN8`.\n    If none of the input boolean variables are true, `M` is assigned an empty string `''`.\n\n  -- Summary\n    The core logic of this functional block is to select the first true input boolean variable in priority order and output the corresponding string. If none of the inputs are true, an empty string is output. This logic is suitable for scenarios where a single output needs to be selected based on multiple conditions.", "name": "MESSAGE_8"}

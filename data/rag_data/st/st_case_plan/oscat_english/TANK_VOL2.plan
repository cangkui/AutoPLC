{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\n  The function is named `TANK_VOL2` and is used to calculate the volume of a container with a specific shape. Based on the given container radius (`TR`) and liquid level height (`H`), it computes the volume using a mathematical formula.\n\n- Variable Definitions\n  The code defines two types of variables:\n  - Input variables: `TR` (container radius) and `H` (liquid level height).\n  - Output variable: `TANK_VOL2` (the calculated container volume).\n\n- Main Logic Section\n  -- REGION Calculate Volume\n    This region contains the core logic of the function for calculating the container volume. The formula is:\n    ```\n    TANK_VOL2 := OSCAT_BASIC.math.PI * H * H * (TR - H/3.0)\n    ```\n    Where:\n    - `OSCAT_BASIC.math.PI` is the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi).\n    - `H * H` is the square of the liquid level height.\n    - `(TR - H/3.0)` is the radius minus one-third of the liquid level height.\n    This formula is suitable for calculating the volume of containers with specific shapes (e.g., spherical or partially spherical).\n  -- REGION End\n    After completing the function logic, it returns the calculated volume value `TANK_VOL2`.", "name": "TANK_VOL2"}

{"variables": [], "instructions": [], "planning": "- Overview\nThis code defines a function block named `SWITCH_X`, designed to handle switch logic for multiple input signals and generate corresponding output signals. The function block also includes debounce functionality to ensure input signal stability.\n\n- Variable Definitions\nThe code defines the following types of variables:\n - Input variables: `IN1` to `IN6` represent six input signals, and `t_debounce` represents the debounce time.\n - Output variables: `Q1` to `Q6` and `Q31` to `Q62` represent multiple output signals.\n - Internal variables: `init` is used as an initialization flag, `T1` to `T6` are debounce timers, `tx` stores the debounce time, `x1` and `x2` store intermediate states, and `E1` and `E2` store timer states.\n\n- Main Logic Section\n-- REGION Initialization\n   This region handles the initialization logic of the function block. If `init` is `FALSE`, initialization is performed. First, it checks whether the debounce time `t_debounce` is less than 50ms. If so, it sets it to 50ms; otherwise, it uses the user-defined value. Then, it initializes the debounce timers `T1` to `T6` and sets their preset times to `tx`. Finally, it sets `init` to `TRUE`, indicating that initialization is complete. This ensures the function block is correctly configured with debounce time and ready to process input signals upon first execution.\n\n-- REGION Default Outputs\n   If `init` is `TRUE`, all output signals `Q1` to `Q6` and `Q31` to `Q62` are set to `FALSE` to ensure a known initial state. This step guarantees that all outputs are in a predictable state before processing begins, preventing unintended behavior due to uninitialized variables.\n\n-- REGION Debounce Processing\n   This region handles the debounce logic for input signals. The input signals `IN1` to `IN6` are connected to the inputs of debounce timers `T1` to `T6`, respectively. The timers filter the input signals based on the preset debounce time `tx` to ensure signal stability. This logic eliminates transient fluctuations or noise, ensuring only stable signals are processed further.\n\n-- REGION State Detection\n   This region detects timer states and sets intermediate variables. If timer `T1` outputs `TRUE` and `E1` is `FALSE`, `x1` is set to `TRUE`. Similarly, if timer `T2` outputs `TRUE` and `E2` is `FALSE`, `x2` is set to `TRUE`. These intermediate variables store the stable states of input signals for use in subsequent logic. State detection ensures subsequent processing is triggered only when timer outputs are stable.\n\n-- REGION Output Logic\n   This region generates output signals based on timer states and intermediate variables. The output logic is divided into the following parts:\n   - If `T1` outputs `TRUE`, the states of `T3` to `T6` are checked. Depending on these states, output signals `Q31` to `Q61` are set, and `x1` is reset to `FALSE`. This logic handles the combination of `IN1` with other input signals to generate corresponding outputs.\n   - If `T2` outputs `TRUE`, the states of `T3` to `T6` are checked. Depending on these states, output signals `Q32` to `Q62` are set, and `x2` is reset to `FALSE`. This logic handles the combination of `IN2` with other input signals to generate corresponding outputs.\n   - If `T1` outputs `FALSE`, `E1` is `TRUE`, and `x1` is `TRUE`, `Q1` is set to `TRUE`, and `x1` is reset to `FALSE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN1`, ensuring `Q1` is generated only after `IN1` stabilizes.\n   - If `T2` outputs `FALSE`, `E2` is `TRUE`, and `x2` is `TRUE`, `Q2` is set to `TRUE`, and `x2` is reset to `FALSE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN2`, ensuring `Q2` is generated only after `IN2` stabilizes.\n   - If `T3` outputs `TRUE`, `Q3` is set to `TRUE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN3`.\n   - If `T4` outputs `TRUE`, `Q4` is set to `TRUE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN4`.\n   - If `T5` outputs `TRUE`, `Q5` is set to `TRUE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN5`.\n   - If `T6` outputs `TRUE`, `Q6` is set to `TRUE`. This logic handles the independent output for `IN6`.\n\n-- REGION State Update\n   This region updates timer states. The output states of `T1` and `T2` are stored in `E1` and `E2`, respectively, for use in the next cycle. This ensures correct detection of timer state changes in subsequent cycles, maintaining logic continuity and accuracy.\n\nThrough this detailed logic, the function block generates accurate and reliable output signals based on input states, with debounce logic ensuring signal stability. Each input signal's processing is carefully designed to guarantee precise and dependable outputs.", "name": "SWITCH_X"}

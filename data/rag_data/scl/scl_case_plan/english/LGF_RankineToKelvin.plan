Step 1: Determine the Temperature Conversion Formula  
Based on the physical relationship between Rankine and Kelvin, the conversion formula is: Kelvin = Rankine Ã— (5/9)  

Step 2: Define the Proportional Factor Constants  
Declare two immutable constants:  
- Numerator constant: 5.0  
- Denominator constant: 9.0  

Step 3: Perform the Linear Conversion Calculation  
Execute the operations in the following order:  
1. Divide the numerator by the denominator to obtain the proportional factor.  
2. Multiply the input temperature value by this proportional factor.  

Step 4: Output the Conversion Result  
Assign the calculated result directly to the function return value without intermediate variable storage.

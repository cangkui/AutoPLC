Algorithm Process Description Based on Requirements and Sample Code:

1. Initialize Conversion Parameters  
   - Set conversion format to integer mode (FORMAT=16#0000)  
   - Configure character parsing start position as the 1st character (P=1)  

2. Call System Conversion Function STRG_VAL  
   - Pass string value as input parameter  
   - Apply predefined conversion format and start position  
   - Store output result in a temporary DInt variable  

3. Output Processing  
   - Directly assign temporary variable value to function return value  
   - Rely on built-in error handling mechanism of system function, no additional status judgment required

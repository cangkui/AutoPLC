Natural Language Requirements:

1. Preprocessing Phase:
- Define constants:
   - All-ones mask (BINARY_ONES = 16#FFFFFFFF)
   - Unit mask (TRUE_BOOL_BIT = 16#0001)
   - Maximum bit limit (MAX_NO_OF_BITS = 32)

2. Input Validation:
- Perform modulo operation on bitNo (bitNo MOD 32) to ensure operation stays within 0-31 bit range

3. Core Bit Manipulation Logic:
a) Use SHL instruction to left-shift the unit mask by the calculated effective bit number
b) Apply XOR operation between the shifted result and all-ones mask to generate the reset mask for target bit
c) Perform AND operation between the generated reset mask and input value to complete bit clearing

4. Output Handling:
- Directly return the bit operation result
- Keep ENO always as TRUE

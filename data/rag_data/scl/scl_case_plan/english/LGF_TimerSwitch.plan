Natural Language Requirements:

Below is the algorithm flow chain of thought summary based on requirements and code implementation:

### 1. Initialization Phase  
- Initialize hour/minute/second parameters for on/off times  
- Clear nanosecond field to 0  

### 2. Time Acquisition and Validation  
- Call RD_LOC_T to read local time  
- Detect time reading errors (when status code highest bit is 1)  
- Error handling: Set error flag, assign ERR_RD_LOC_T status code  

### 3. Mode Routing Logic  
```plaintext
         ┌───────────────┐  
         │ Mode Selection │  
         └───────┬───────┘  
                 │  
    ┌────────────┴────────────┐  
    ▼                         ▼  
Special Mode Handling      Scheduled Mode Handling  
(Always On/Off)            (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly etc.)  
```

### 4. Core Processing Logic for Each Mode  

#### Daily Mode (MODE_DAILY)  
- Construct same-day on/off time structure  
- Handle midnight crossover:  
  - When on-time > off-time  
  - Adjust next-day time range based on current time  

#### Weekly Cycle Mode (MODE_WEEKLY)  
- Build time structure based on current day of week  
- Handle weekly boundaries:  
  - When start day > end day  
  - Add week compensation for cross-week scenarios  

#### Monthly Cycle Mode (MODE_MONTHLY)  
- Construct current month date-time structure  
- Handle month-end boundaries:  
  - When start date > end date  
  - Adjust month field for cross-month handling  

#### Yearly Cycle Mode (MODE_YEARLY)  
- Construct current year time structure  
- Handle year-end boundaries:  
  - When start month > end month  
  - Adjust year field for cross-year handling  

#### Workday Mode (MODE_WEEK_DAYS)  
- Restrict to Monday-Friday range  
- Special handling for Friday night to Monday morning:  
  - Force deactivation during weekend periods  

#### Weekend Mode (MODE_WEEKEND_DAYS)  
- Restrict to Saturday-Sunday range  
- Handle weekend boundaries:  
  - Auto-correct to next weekend period  
  - Process Sunday night to next Saturday interval  

### 5. Time Range Determination  
- Final time comparison logic:  
```plaintext
signal = (Current Time ∈ [Adjusted On-Time, Adjusted Off-Time))  
         AND Not Permanent Off Mode  
         OR Permanent On Mode  
```

### 6. Error Handling Strategy  
- Invalid mode detection: Set ERR_NO_MODE_SELECTED  
- Time read exception: Set ERR_RD_LOC_T  
- Force signal=false on errors  

### 7. Output Processing  
- Unified output of current local time  
- Hierarchical status codes:  
  - Main status code (status)  
  - Sub-status code (subFunctionStatus)

Natural Language Requirements:  

1. **Effective Processing**:  
   - Perform modulo operation on the input bit number: `bitNo % 32`  

2. **Mask Generation**:  
   - Left-shift the binary base value 1 (i.e., `0x00000001`) by the adjusted bit number  

3. **Bit Detection Operation**:  
   - Perform a bitwise AND operation between the input value and the generated mask  
   - Compare whether the operation result is not equal to zero  

4. **Result Output**:  
   - If the AND operation result is non-zero → Return `TRUE`  
   - If the AND operation result is zero → Return `FALSE`

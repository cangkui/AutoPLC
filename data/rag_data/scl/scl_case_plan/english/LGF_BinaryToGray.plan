Natural Language Requirements:  
1. Perform a bitwise XOR operation between the input binary value and its result after being right-shifted by 1 bit.  
   - The right shift uses a logical right shift (high bits filled with 0s).  

2. Mathematical Expression:  
   Gray = Binary ^ (Binary >> 1)  

3. Direct Output:  
   - The conversion result does not require additional processing; directly return the value after the XOR operation.  
   - No intermediate variables are needed; the conversion can be completed with a single-line operation.

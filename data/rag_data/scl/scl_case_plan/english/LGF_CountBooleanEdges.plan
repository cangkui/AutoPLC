**Natural Language Requirements:**  

1. **Edge Detection**  
   - Detect rising edges by comparing the current `trigger` signal with its state in the previous cycle (`statTriggerPrevious`).  
   - If an edge is detected (current state is `TRUE` and previous state was `FALSE`), trigger subsequent processing.  

2. **Timer Control**  
   - Upon edge detection, start a TP-type timer (`instTimer`) with a duration of `monitorTime`.  
   - While the timer is running (`Q=TRUE`), continue monitoring for edge events.  

3. **Edge Counting**  
   - Increment the counter `statTriggerCounter` each time an edge is detected.  
   - Continue accumulating edge counts while the timer is active.  

4. **State Determination (Timer Expiration)**  
   - **When the timer expires (`Q=FALSE`):** Determine the output type based on the final state of `trigger` and the edge count:  
     - **`trigger=FALSE` and timer expired** → Reset all outputs and counters.  
     - **`trigger=TRUE` and edge count = 1** → Classify as `long` (sustained high level).  
     - **Edge count = 1** → Output `single`.  
     - **Edge count = 2** → Output `double`.  
     - **Edge count ≥ 3** → Output `severalEdges`.  
   - Record the final edge count in `noOfEdges`.  

5. **Output Hold**  
   - Pass the determination result to the output via a temporary variable to ensure the output remains valid for at least one cycle after expiration.

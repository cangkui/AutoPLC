### LGF_Random_Real Algorithm Process Description  

#### Core Logic  
1. **Generate Random Seed Based on System Time**  
   The initial random number seed is generated by reading the nanosecond portion of the system time (high-precision timestamp) and performing a nonlinear byte-order swap on it.  

#### Execution Flow  
1. **System Time Retrieval and Validation**  
   - Call the `RD_SYS_T` system function to obtain the current time with nanosecond precision.  
   - Check the system call status code:  
     - If failed:  
       * Set the `error` flag.  
       * Set the main status code to `ERR_RD_SYS_T`.  
       * Retain the sub-status code as the error code returned by the system.  
       * Return `0.0` and exit.  

2. **Seed Generation Strategy**  
   - Extract the `NANOSECOND` field (32-bit unsigned integer) from the time structure.  
   - Perform byte cross-mapping:  
     ```
     Seed byte[3] ← Original nanosecond byte[0]  
     Seed byte[2] ← Original nanosecond byte[1]  
     Seed byte[1] ← Original nanosecond byte[2]  
     Seed byte[0] ← Original nanosecond byte[3]  
     ```

3. **Value Normalization**  
   - Convert the generated 32-bit seed into a floating-point number.  
   - Divide by `4294967295.0` (the maximum value of UDINT) to achieve linear mapping within the range [0.0, 1.0].  

4. **Successful Status Return**  
   - Clear the error flag.  
   - Set the main status code to `STATUS_FINISHED_NO_ERROR`.  
   - Retain the sub-status code as the successful system call code.

### Algorithm Process Description (Thought Chain Analysis)  

1. **Function Positioning**  
   Combine 16 independent Boolean variables into a single WORD-type variable based on bit order (bit15 as the highest bit, bit0 as the lowest bit).  

2. **Core Logic**  
   - **Bit-to-Word Mapping**: Assign Boolean values to the binary bits of the WORD variable one by one.  
   - **Memory Optimization**: Use a temporary variable to store intermediate results, avoiding direct operations on the output parameter.  

3. **Execution Steps**  
   ```python  
   def LGF_MergeBitsToWord():  
       # Initialize temporary variable  
       tempWord = 0x0000  
         
       # Map from high to low bit order (bit15 corresponds to the 15th bit of WORD)  
       tempWord.bit[15] = bit15  
       tempWord.bit[14] = bit14  
       ...  
       tempWord.bit[0] = bit0  
         
       # Output result  
       return tempWord  
   ```  

4. **Code Adaptation Points**  
   - **Bit Order Alignment**: Use the %Xn bit addressing method to ensure bit15 corresponds to the highest bit of WORD.  
   - **Variable Reuse**: Centralize operations via the temporary variable #tempWord and assign the final value to the function return result uniformly.

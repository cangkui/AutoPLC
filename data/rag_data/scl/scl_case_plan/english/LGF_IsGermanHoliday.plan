**Natural Language Requirements:**

1. **Easter Calculation**:
- Use the Gauss algorithm to calculate the date of Easter for the input year.
- Determine the month of Easter (March or April) using modulo operations and coefficient adjustments.
- Calculate the number of days between April 1st and Easter.

2. **Fixed-Date Holiday Determination**:
```
January 1st (New Year's Day)
May 1st (Labor Day)
October 3rd (German Unity Day)
December 25th/26th (Christmas)

August 8th (Augsburg Peace Festival)
August 15th (Assumption of Mary)
October 31st (Reformation Day)
November 1st (All Saints' Day)
```

4. **Dynamic Holiday Calculation**:
- Rose Monday (48 days before Easter, requires parameter activation)
- Good Friday (2 days before Easter)
- Easter and Easter Monday (+0/+1 day)
- Ascension Day (+39 days, requires parameter activation)
- Pentecost and Whit Monday (+49/+50 days)
- Corpus Christi (+60 days, requires parameter activation)

5. **Special Dynamic Holiday**:
- Day of Prayer and Repentance (3rd Wednesday in November, requires parameter activation)
â†’ Condition check: November, Wednesday, 15 < DAY < 23

6. **Combined Determination**:
All the above conditions are connected via logical OR. If any condition is met, return TRUE.

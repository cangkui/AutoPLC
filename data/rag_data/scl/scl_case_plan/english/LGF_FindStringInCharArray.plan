Natural Language Requirements:  

1. **Initialization Phase**  
- Set the initial search position to the input starting point `startPos`  
- Get and cache the length of the target string  
- Preset the return value to `-1` (indicating "not found" status)  
- Validate the input array (check for valid character/byte array type)  

2. **Input Validation Process**  
- Verify whether `searchIn` is a valid array type  
- Immediately return `ERR_NO_ARRAY` error if the type is invalid  
- If valid, retrieve the total array length for later use  

3. **Sliding Window Search Loop**  
   ```text  
   While the current window is within bounds:  
     1. Window Construction:  
        - Extract up to 254 characters from the current array position (to comply with legacy system limits)  
        - Convert into a temporary variable of standard STRING type  
        
     2. String Matching:  
        - Perform substring search within the temporary string  
        - Record the relative position of the substring within the temporary string  
        
     3. Hit Handling:  
        - Calculate the absolute position in the actual array = window start position + relative position - 1  
        - Immediately return the hit position and exit the loop  
        
     4. Window Sliding:  
        - Step length = window length - target string length + 1  
        - Ensure no cross-window matching possibilities are missed  
   ```  

4. **Termination Conditions**  
- Success condition: The substring is found in any window  
- Failure condition: The window slides beyond the array length range  
- On failure, retain the initial return value of `-1`

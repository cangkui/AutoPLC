```python
Algorithm Process Description (Chain of Thought version):
1. Initialize swap starting point:
   - Get the starting index of the array (LOWER_BOUND)

2. Determine loop boundary:
   - Get the maximum index of the array (UPPER_BOUND)

3. Establish loop control:
   - Continue processing while current index is less than maximum index

4. Core swap logic:
   a. Store current element in temporary variable
   b. Place high-order byte (B1) into low-order byte position (B0)
   c. Place low-order byte (B0) into high-order byte position (B1)

5. Move pointer:
   - Index increment step is fixed at 1 (NEXT_ELEMENT constant)

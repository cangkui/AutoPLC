**Natural Language Requirements:**  

#### **Core Logic Adjustment Approach**  
1. **Operation Priority**: The reset operation has the highest priority (immediately resets the pointer), while push/pop operations are processed in sequence within the same scan cycle.  
2. **Minimum Value Handling Strategy**: Use real-time search mode—each pop operation traverses all current elements to locate the minimum value position, avoiding the maintenance of auxiliary stacks.  
3. **Array Operation Characteristics**: When deleting a middle element, shift subsequent elements forward to maintain array continuity.

#### **Detailed Execution Flow**  

**1. Initial Configuration**  
```sccl  
Set stack capacity constant = 4  
Initialize stack pointer = 0  
Default error state = FALSE  
Default status code = 16#0000  
```  

**2. Operation Processing Sequence**  
```  
Reset → Push → Pop → Status Update  
```  

**3. Reset Operation**  
```sccl  
IF reset rising edge THEN  
   Reset stack pointer to zero (physically retains array data)  
   Preserve original array elements (overwritten by subsequent operations in actual use)  
```  

**4. Push Operation**  
```sccl  
IF push triggered AND stack pointer < 4 THEN  
   stack[current pointer] = input value  
   Auto-increment pointer  
ELSE IF stack is full  
   Set error state = TRUE  
   Status code = 16#8A04  
   Return immediately (skip subsequent operations)  
```  

**5. Pop Operation**  
```sccl  
IF pop triggered THEN  
   |-- Empty stack check --  
   IF stack pointer = 0  
      Set error state = TRUE  
      Status code = 16#8A05  
      Return immediately  

   |-- Locate minimum value --  
   Initialize min_index = 0  
   FOR i = 1 TO stack pointer - 1:  
      IF stack[i] < stack[min_index]  
         Update min_index  

   |-- Element removal strategy --  
   Save return value = stack[min_index]  
   IF min_index is not at the top:  
      Shift subsequent elements forward (from min_index to top - 1)  
   Clear original top position as 0  
   Auto-decrement pointer  
```  

**6. Boundary Condition Handling**  
```sccl  
After each operation:  
   IF no errors triggered  
      Reset error = FALSE  
      Status code = 16#0000  
   ELSE  
      Maintain error state until the next valid operation  
```

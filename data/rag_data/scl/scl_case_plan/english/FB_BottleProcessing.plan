Natural Language Requirements:  

1. State Machine Initialization Phase  
   - Set initial state to "Waiting for Bottle Detection" (STATE_WAITING_FOR_BOTTLE)  
   - Reset all actuator outputs (pumps/valves/mechanisms/indicator lights)  

2. Bottle Detection Trigger Process  
   ├─ When bottle sensor is activated  
   └─ Transition to "Cleaning State" (STATE_CLEANING)  
       ├─ Activate cleaning pump (Pump_Motor = TRUE)  
       └─ Wait for operator's cleaning confirmation signal  

3. Cleaning Confirmation Handling Phase  
   ├─ Upon receiving cleaning confirmation button signal  
   └─ Transition to "Filling State" (STATE_FILLING)  
       ├─ Deactivate cleaning pump (Pump_Motor = FALSE)  
       ├─ Open filling valve (Filling_Valve = TRUE)  
       └─ Wait for operator's filling confirmation signal  

4. Filling Confirmation Handling Phase  
   ├─ Upon receiving filling confirmation button signal  
   └─ Transition to "Capping State" (STATE_CAPPING)  
       ├─ Close filling valve (Filling_Valve = FALSE)  
       ├─ Activate capping machine (Capping_Machine = TRUE)  
       └─ Wait for operator's capping confirmation signal  

5. Capping Confirmation Handling Phase  
   ├─ Upon receiving capping confirmation button signal  
   └─ Transition to "Packing State" (STATE_PACKING)  
       ├─ Deactivate capping machine (Capping_Machine = FALSE)  
       ├─ Activate packing machine (Packing_Machine = TRUE)  
       └─ Wait for operator's packing confirmation signal  

6. Packing Completion Handling Phase  
   ├─ Upon receiving packing confirmation button signal  
   └─ Transition to "Completed State" (STATE_COMPLETED)  
       ├─ Deactivate packing machine (Packing_Machine = FALSE)  
       ├─ Turn on completion indicator light (Completion_Light = TRUE)  
       └─ Wait for final pickup confirmation  

7. System Reset Phase  
   ├─ Upon receiving pickup completion button signal  
   └─ Return to initial waiting state (STATE_WAITING_FOR_BOTTLE)  
       └─ Turn off completion indicator light (Completion_Light = FALSE)

Natural Language Requirements:  

1. **Initialization and Reset Handling**  
- Detect reset signal or window size change → Clear historical data and counters  
- Validate window size → Set error code 16#8200 if invalid  

2. **Trigger Logic Judgment**  
- Triggered by `cyclicExecution` or rising edge of `trigger` → Determine whether to execute the current calculation  
- Implement edge detection to ensure each trigger is processed only once  

3. **Window Filling Phase**  
- When accumulated samples < window size:  
   - Add new value to the circular buffer  
   - Accumulate into the total sum and increment the counter  
   - Calculate the average using the current total  

4. **Sliding Window Phase**  
- After the window is filled:  
   - Perform circular buffer replacement (new value replaces the oldest value)  
   - Update the total sum: `New Sum = Original Sum + New Value - Replaced Value`  
   - Always calculate the average based on the full window size  

5. **Index Management Mechanism**  
- Use `MOD` operation for circular buffer index looping  
- Special handling for modulo reset cases → Reset counters to maintain window integrity  

6. **Status Output Control**  
- Update the `windowSizeReached` flag in real time  
- Automatically clear error status during normal execution  
- Force ENO to remain TRUE → Errors are reported through dedicated channels

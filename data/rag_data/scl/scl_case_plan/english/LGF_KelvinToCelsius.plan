Natural Language Requirements:  

1. **Define Constant Offset**  
   Set the fixed constant `273.15` as the offset (the difference between Kelvin and Celsius).  

2. **Temperature Conversion Calculation**  
   Subtract the constant offset directly from the input Kelvin temperature value to obtain the Celsius temperature value.  
   **Formula**: `Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15`  

3. **Output Result and Status**  
   - Assign the calculation result to the function's return value.  
   - No error handling logic is included; always set `ENO = TRUE` to indicate successful execution.

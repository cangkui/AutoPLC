Natural Language Requirements:  

1. **Low-Order Bits Extraction**: Use bitmask 0xFFFF to directly extract the lower 16 bits of a double word.  
   - Mask operation: `word0 = doubleWord AND 0xFFFF`  

2. **High-Order Bits Extraction**:  
   - Right-shift by 16 bits: Shift the entire double word right by 16 bits to move the high-order 16 bits into the lower bit positions.  
   - Mask filtering: `word1 = (doubleWord >> 16) AND 0xFFFF`

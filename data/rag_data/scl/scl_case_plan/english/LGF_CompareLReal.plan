Natural language requirements:  
1. Initialize the return value to FALSE.  
2. Perform a three-way condition check (OR logic):  
   - Condition 1: When valueA is 0, verify that the absolute value of valueB ≤ precision.  
   - Condition 2: When valueB is 0, verify that the absolute value of valueA ≤ precision.  
   - Condition 3: Calculate the absolute difference between the two values ≤ (precision × |valueA|).  
3. If any condition is met, return TRUE.

Natural Language Requirements:

1. Dimension Check Phase:
   - Obtain the row and column boundaries of the input matrices and result matrix
   - Verify the feasibility conditions for matrix multiplication:
     a. The column range of matrix1 must exactly match the row range of matrix2 (check both upper and lower bounds)
     b. The row count of the result matrix must exactly match the row range of matrix1
     c. The column count of the result matrix must exactly match the column range of matrix2
   - Immediately set error status and exit if any condition fails

2. Matrix Initialization Phase:
   - Initialize each element of the result matrix to 0.0

3. Triple Loop Calculation Phase:
   for each row in matrix1's row range:
       for each column in matrix2's column range:
           Initialize accumulator tempResult as 0.0
           for common_dimension in matrix1's column range (i.e., matrix2's row range):
               tempResult += matrix1's current row element * matrix2's current column element
           Store the final computation result in the corresponding position of the result matrix

4. Status Setting Phase:
   - Upon successful completion, set error=false and normal status code
   - Explicitly set ENO mechanism to TRUE

Natural Language Requirements:

Based on requirements and code analysis, the thought process of this string-to-time conversion algorithm can be divided into the following four logical stages:

1. Initialization Phase:
- Create a temporary string copy and a millisecond accumulator variable
- Predefine millisecond base values for each time unit (D/H/M/S/MS)

2. Sequential Parsing Phase (in descending order of time unit granularity):
- Day (D) parsing: Locate "D" character → Extract prefix numeric value → Calculate corresponding milliseconds → Trim processed string portion
- Hour (H) parsing: Apply same pattern but using H character and hour-to-millisecond base
- Minute (M) parsing: Continue the same pattern
- Second (S) parsing: Note the use of single-character identifier here
- Millisecond (MS) parsing: Special handling for two-character identifier, no subsequent trimming needed

3. Accumulation Characteristics:
- Incremental accumulation approach: Use += operator to accumulate total milliseconds after each parsing
- Dynamic string trimming: After successfully parsing each unit, remove processed portion to form new string

4. Result Conversion Phase:
- Convert final accumulated integer millisecond value to standard TIME type using DINT_TO_TIME function
- Force ENO flag to True (following design constraint of no error handling)

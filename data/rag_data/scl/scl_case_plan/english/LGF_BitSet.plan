Natural Language Requirements:  

1. Bit Number Validity Handling:  
   - Use MOD 32 operation to constrain bitNo within the valid range of 0-31.  

2. Mask Generation:  
   - Initialize a DWORD constant with the least significant bit set to 1 (16#0001).  
   - Perform a left shift operation on the constant, with the shift amount equal to the processed bitNo value.  

3. Bit Setting Operation:  
   - Perform a bitwise OR operation between the original value and the shifted mask.  
   - The result includes all originally set bits of the original value plus the newly specified bit.  

4. Return Result:  
   - Output the combined DWORD value as the final result.

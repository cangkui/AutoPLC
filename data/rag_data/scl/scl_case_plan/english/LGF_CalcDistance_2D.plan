Natural Language Requirements:

1. Input Parameters:
   - Accept coordinates of two 2D points: (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
   - All parameters are of LReal type

2. Calculation Logic:
   ① Calculate the difference in x-coordinates: Δx = x2 - x1
   ② Calculate the difference in y-coordinates: Δy = y2 - y1
   ③ Sum the squares of the x and y differences: sum_of_squares = (Δx)² + (Δy)²
   ④ Calculate the square root of the sum: distance = √(sum_of_squares)

3. Output Result:
   - Return the calculated distance value (LReal type)
   - Perform the calculation directly using a mathematical expression without storing intermediate variables

4. Special Handling:
   - Force set ENO to TRUE
   - Skip numerical range validation

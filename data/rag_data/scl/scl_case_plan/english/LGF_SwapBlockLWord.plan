Natural Language Requirements:  

1. Array Boundary Determination Phase:  
   - Get the starting index of the array (LOWER_BOUND)  
   - Pre-calculate the ending index of the array (UPPER_BOUND) to avoid repeated calls  

2. Traversal Control Phase:  
   ￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣  
   | Initialize traversal index → Starting index  
   | Loop condition → Index has not reached the end boundary  
   | Index increment → Increase by 1 each time  
   ￣  

3. Byte Swap Core Operation (for each LWord element):  
   ① Cache the original value → tempSwapValue  
   ② Perform 8-byte position reversal:  
      B0↔B7 | B1↔B6 | B2↔B5 | B3↔B4  
   ③ In-place update → Directly modify the corresponding array element  

4. Termination Conditions:  
   - Natural termination → Index reaches the upper bound of the array  
   - Forced flag → ENO set to TRUE indicates successful execution

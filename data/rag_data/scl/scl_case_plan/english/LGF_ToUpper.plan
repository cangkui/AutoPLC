Natural Language Requirements:

Below is the algorithm process chain refined based on requirements and code:

1. Initialization Phase:
   - Clear the result string buffer
   - Get the length of the input string (to avoid repeated calculations)
   - Initialize the character index pointer to starting position 1

2. Character Traversal Processing:
   â–¶ Loop Condition: Index does not exceed string length
   a. Character Range Judgment:
      - When the character ASCII code is between 'a'(97) and 'z'(122)
   b. Conversion Logic:
      - Perform ASCII minus 32 (uppercase conversion) on qualifying characters
      - Other characters remain unchanged
   c. Result Construction:
      - Append the processed character to the end of the result string
      - Increment the index pointer to the next position

3. Result Return:
   - Output the final constructed string as the function result
   - Always set ENO to True to indicate successful execution

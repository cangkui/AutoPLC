Here's the translation of the natural language requirements into English:

1. **Execution Control**  
   - Detect rising edges of enqueue/dequeue/clear signals  
   - When no trigger signal is present:  
     * Set status to "No current task" (16#7000)  
     * Immediately terminate processing  

2. **Input Validation**  
   - Verify if buffer is an array → Error 16#8200  
   - Check type consistency between item and buffer elements → Error 16#8201  
   - Check type consistency between initialItem and item → Error 16#8202  
   - Validate index range validity → Errors 16#8601/16#8602  

3. **Buffer Initialization**  
   - Upon receiving reset signal:  
     * Reset head/tail pointers (head=-1, tail=0)  
     * Reset element count to zero  
   - Upon detecting clear signal's rising edge:  
     * Fill entire buffer with initialItem  
     * Perform same initialization operations as reset  

4. **Dequeue Operation (dequeue rising edge)**  
   - Check for empty buffer state → Error 16#8001  
   - Read head element to item output  
   - Replace dequeued position with initialItem  
   - Circular index calculation:  
     * New head pointer = (current head +1) mod buffer size  
     * If new head equals tail pointer → Reset to empty state  
   - Decrement element counter  

5. **Enqueue Operation (enqueue rising edge)**  
   - Check for full buffer state → Error 16#8002  
   - Write item to tail pointer position  
   - Circular index update:  
     * Tail pointer = (current tail +1) mod buffer size  
   - If first element enqueued → Initialize head pointer to 0  
   - Increment element counter  

6. **Status Updates**  
   - Output current element count (elementCount)  
   - Update isEmpty flag (set when count ≤ 0)  
   - Set normal status code 16#0000

Natural Language Requirements:  

1. Coordinate Difference Calculation:  
   - Calculate the differences for each of the x, y, and z coordinate axes (x2 - x1, y2 - y1, z2 - z1).  

2. Squaring Operation:  
   - Square each of the coordinate differences (using the SQR function).  

3. Summation:  
   - Add the squared results of the three coordinate axes to obtain the sum of squares.  

4. Square Root Operation:  
   - Compute the square root of the sum of squares (using the SQRT function).  

5. Result Return:  
   - Directly return the calculated result as the function value.  
   - Do not enable the ENO mechanism (always set to TRUE).

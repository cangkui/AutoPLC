Natural Language Requirements: ### Algorithm Process Description  

1. **Define Temperature Gain Constant**  
   - Declare a fixed coefficient of 1.8 (the temperature scale ratio between Kelvin and Rankine).  

2. **Perform Temperature Unit Conversion**  
   - Multiply the input Kelvin temperature value by the fixed coefficient.  
   - Calculation formula: `Rankine = Kelvin Ã— 1.8`.  

3. **Directly Output the Result**  
   - Map the calculation result directly to the function return value.  
   - Keep ENO always as TRUE (no error handling mechanism).
